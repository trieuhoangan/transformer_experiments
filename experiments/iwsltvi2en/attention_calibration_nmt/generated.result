When I was a child , I thought , The Korean is the best country in the world , and I often sang , We have nothing to envy .
I was very proud of my country .
In schools , we spent a lot of time learning about the life of the Great Kim -- Sung , but we did n't learn a lot about the world outside , except for the United States , Korea and Japan are our enemies .
Although I used to wondered what the outside world was out there , but I still think I would live my whole life in the Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven , I saw people shoot for the first time in my life , but I still think my life was completely normal .
My family was not poor , and I was not hungry .
But on a day of 1995 , my mother brought home a letter from a sister with her mother .
In there , she says , When you read these lines , all five of your family has left this life , because all of your family has had nothing to eat in two weeks .
All lies on the floor , and our bodies are so sick that death is very close .
I was shocked .
Because that was the first time I knew that my people were suffering .
Shortly after , when I went through a gas station , I saw a horror scene that I could never forget .
On the station is the dead of a woman whose hands are still holding a baby , and the child just staring at her face .
But no one has to help them , because it s all about to worry about themselves and family .
In the mid-90s , North Korea underwent an famine .
It makes more than a million people die in famine , and many who just survive to eat the grasses , the bugs and the trees .
And so the luxury of electricity is happening all the time , so everything around me goes to the dark , except that the light bulbs from China is just a river .
I always wondered why they had electricity , we did n't .
This is a photograph from North Korean imaging satellites at night in relation to countries around .
This is the Ride River River Ride , which is the border between North Korea and China .
And you can see that the river has very small , so some of the North Koreans get over to China .
But a lot of people died .
And I saw them floating around the river .
I ca n't talk specifically about how I 've escape North Korea can only tell you that in the hard years , it s hard to say that I 'm sent to China to live with a relatives .
I just thought I 'd have to go a long time away .
I could have imagined that I was going to have to go far from them 14 years from now .
In China , her life was separated from my family like I was very difficult .
I had no idea what was going to happen to a refugee life from North Korea is going to be like , but I realized soon that it was not that hard , it was very dangerous , because the North Koreans from North Korea into China .
I always live in a regular fear that my identity is going to be discovered , and I 'm going to be returned to my old life in North Korea .
And one day , that nightmare came true , and I was arrested by the Chinese police to come and to the police station .
Somebody said to them that I 'm North Koreans , so they tested my Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions .
I was so scared , and I felt like my heart was about to blow out .
Because if they saw something unnatural , I would get in a prison and get back to the water .
I think my life is over here , but I still try to control my emotions and answer their questions .
After the finish , one of the two policemen said to the other , This is an wrong case .
It s not North Koreans .
And they drop me out . It s a miracle .
Some of the North Koreans in China went to the foreign embroidery ambassadors , but many of them were arrested by the Chinese police and returned to the water .
These girls were very lucky .
Even though it was arrested , it was finally learned to come up with the force from the international community .
But the North Koreans are not so lucky .
Every year , there are countless North Koreans who are arrested in China and being returned to the water , where they 're tortured , which is where they are tortured or executed .
While I was very lucky to have been released , a lot of my people do n't .
The North Koreans had to cover their identity and struggle to survive as tragic as a tragic tragedy .
Even when they studied Chinese language and found a job , their lives could be completely confused for a moment .
That s why after 10 years of anonymous identity , I decided to take myself to South Korea , to start a new life .
My life was much harder than I imagined .
Because in South Korea , English has a very important position , so I began to learn English , my third language .
I also realized a huge gap between South and North Korea .
We were all Teachers , but we had become very different from the effects of 67 years divided .
I experienced a crisis in my origin .
I 'm South Koreans and North Korea ?
Where am I ? And who am I ?
Suddenly , I had no country to be proud of as the Organization .
Even in order to adapt to the life in South Korea is not easy , but I made a plan .
And we started to learn how to prepare for college .
However , even though I 've just gotten used to my life here , I 've got a terrible news .
The North Korean government found out how much money I sent back to my family , and , in order to punish it , they would have to take my family around the countryside .
So they could get out of there , and I started planning to help my family escape .
North Koreans have overcome the distance of unthinkable distance to come free .
Because cross-border cross-border crosses to North Korea is almost impossible , so I had to fly to China and go back to the border of North Korea .
Because my family did n't know Chinese , so I had to go with people through 2 , 000 miles in China and go to the East Asia .
The journey of the bus lasted about a week , and we were almost arrested .
So one time , our car was blocked and was exposed by a Chinese police officer .
He captured the evidence of everybody , and he started investigating .
Because my family did n't understand Chinese language , so I thought they 'd be arrested .
When the Chinese police came up to them , I immediately got up and said to him , These are the deaf people that I 'm going to go with .
He looked at me full suspicion , but fortunately he believed my words .
And we kept on going to the border of the Lord , and I had to use almost all the money that I had to briefly have to briefly bribe the border of the border guard .
However , after we passed the border , my family was arrested for the emission of crossing the border .
After I applied the fine , and I landed briefly , my family was released in a month , and he was arrested again in the capital of the Little .
It was the desperate moment in my life .
I 've done all kinds of ways to get my family to free , and I almost succeeded , but they were arrested while we were just the Korean ambassadors were very short .
I went back in the middle of the room to the police and the police , desperately to find a way to get my family out of there , but I did n't have enough money to pay bribed or pay a penalty .
I was desperate .
At the time , there was a man who asked me , What s wrong with ?
I was very surprised when a totally strange person was interested in asking me .
By the way , my little English language and a dictionary , I told him the circumstances of my family . It was a little bit , because the man went to the ATM machine , and paid all the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them to jail .
I thank you for your whole heart , and I said , Why are you helping me ?
I did n't help her , He said .
' I 'm helping North Koreans .
I realized it was a really meaningful moment in my life .
The kindness from strangers became my new hope for the North Koreans , and the North Koreans when we were really needed it , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and support our international community are the hope that the North Koreans we looked for .
Finally , after a long journey , my family was reunited in South Korea , but it was with only half of the struggle .
A lot of North Koreans are being divided from their families , and when they arrive , they have to start with very little or very little or very little .
So we can get the help from the international community to education , train English , teach English , and so on .
We can also play a role in which the people in North Koreans with the outside world , because there are many of us that are connected to other family members in the country , and we share them with them and money to change North Korea from the inside .
I was very lucky to get a lot of help and be inspired all my life , so I wanted to come together to my country to be able to develop with international support .
I believe that you will see more North Koreans everywhere in the world , but also on the TED stage .
Thank you .
Today I have one request .
Please do n't tell me that I 'm normal .
Now I want to introduce you to my brothers and sisters .
Remi is 22 years old , tall and beautiful .
I ca n't say it , but I get the joy in a way that even some of the best rabbit ca n't do it .
Remi knows what love is .
She shares it unconditionally no matter how .
She was n't greedy . I did n't tell the skin .
I did n't care about religion , and let s understand this : She never lied .
When I sing songs from our childhood , trying to remember the words that I could n't , I remember one thing : we did n't know about the brain at all , and what we do n't know yet .
Samuel was 16 . I was tall . I was also so beautiful .
I have a perfect memory .
But it s also selective .
I do n't remember whether I could whisked my chocolate , but I remembered the year of every single song on my iPod , the conversations between us from my four-year-old , sitting on my hands on my first day of Teletubbies on the first wave of chocolate , and my birthday of Lady Gaga .
These stories are great , right ?
But most people do n't agree .
And in fact , since their minds are not matched with a normal social version , they 're often overlooked and they 're confused .
But what makes my heart more relieved and more powerful is that , although this is true , even though you 're not considered normal , this just means : children are extraordinary -- individuals with autism and people .
For you not very used to the word autism ' it s a brain disorder that affects society s ability to communicate , learn and sometimes autism .
The disease in every single person , is why Remi is so different than Sam .
And all over the world , every 20 minutes there s one more person diagnosed with autism , and even though it s one of the world s fastest developments in the world , we do n't know the cause or the treatment .
And I could n't remember the first time I got access to autism , but I could n't remember one day without it .
I was three years old when my baby was born , and I was incredibly excited that there was one more new person in my life .
And after a few months , I realized I was different .
He yelling a lot .
I do n't want to play like other kids , and in fact , I do n't seem to have any interest in me or anything else .
Remi is alive and intensive in his own world , with its own rule , and I find joy in the smallest things , like sitting around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything in your hands .
When I was growing up , I became more different , and the difference became more apparent .
But beyond the anger and the overlap and the overlap of motivation is something really unique : a pure instinct and a naive instinct , a boy who looks a life without prejudice , prejudice .
Often Africa .
Well , I could n't deny that there was some tough moments in my family , moments that I wished them to look like myself .
But I took my memories back to what they taught me about personality and communication and love and I realized that these are things that I would n't trade to get normal .
Ordinary absurdity makes us look different , and what we do n't mean by one of us is something wrong .
It just means there s one other one ' there s one other one .
And if I can only carry one thing for Remi and for Sam and for you , that s that you do n't have to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because there is autistic , the difference between us -- we have a gift ! Everyone is carrying on a gift , and honestly , pursued with the biggest sacrifice .
Invite for great , progress and for change , when we try to become like somebody else .
Please do n't say that I 'm okay .
Thank you .
You may all agree with me that this is a beautiful path .
It s built from asphalt , and the roads are the kind of material that runs on it , but it s not always on , it s not on these days when it rains a lot .
And then you can get water on the way .
And especially if you take a bicycle bike , and you go through these cars , that s not a good thing .
And also , the plastics also cause a lot of noise .
It s a noisy material , if we make the streets like Holland , very close to cities , we want a quiet path .
The solution to the problem is to make the roads from scratch .
So the route is the material that we 're currently using to build most of the countries in the Netherlands , and it has holes and water just permeates through the hole , so all the rainwater is going to escape , and you have a convenience path to drive . So there s no water .
And the noise also disappeared through the hole .
Because it s so empty , all the noise goes away , so it s very quiet .
Of course there s still a lot of inconveniences , and the uncomfortable thing about this path is that the criteria can happen .
What s the crackers ? You see that on this road the surface , the dirty surface .
So first you get a rock , and then more , more , more , more , more , and more -- oh , I 'm not going to do that .
But they can damage your car , so you 're not happy with that .
And after all , this broken state will fail more and more .
Sometimes they make chicken .
Oh , he s ready .
chicken , of course , can be a problem , but we have a solution .
Actually , what you see here is how this material is damaging .
It s a sponge , as I said , you just have a small amount of glue stuck between the rocks .
In the aftermath of the weather , the solar radiation radiates , this plastic condition , this bitum gluum stitch between these building blocks will contract , and if you contract , it will crack these very small crunchy crackers , and then the mind leaves out .
And then if you drive on that road , you will destroy these blocks to go -- like we 've just seen here .
To address this , we 've created self-assembly materials .
If we created this self-assembly material , then we could find a solution .
What we can do is we can use steel to deflate the bulk , and we cut the little steel mill out , and we seal this little piece of steel , which is bitter , and we sew it up with bitum .
So we have a plastic mixed with very small steel debris .
And then you need a machine , as you can see here , which is a machine that uses to cook -- a magnetic sensor .
The sensors that are able to make heat , particularly steel , are very good .
What you do is you heat up the ball , and you melt the plastic , and the bitum will flow into these little cracks , and the rocks will stick the class back .
Today I use a wave , because I ca n't get the sensor to the stage .
It works the same way .
I 'm going to get the prototype in the oven , and I 'm going to take it now , and look how that goes .
This is the garage here .
I said we invented a industrial machine like this in the lab to heat up the samples .
In the lab we 've tried many models , and then the government , they 've actually seen the result , and they 've got to say , Oh , that s a good way . We have to try it .
And then they gave us a parade , which is 400 meters across the A58 , where we have to build a new material .
So that s what we 've done here . You look at the road we 've done , and then of course this path will survive for years without any harm . That s what we learned from experimentation .
We 've taken lots of samples from this path , and we tried them in the lab .
So we 've aging the sample , we 've put a lot of it on it , put it together with the sensor , put it back and then try it again .
We can do that all the time .
And actually , the conclusion is that if we were to nurture a four-year road by a napshot machine -- this is a big version of the size that we built to do -- if four years we kept trying to nurture the road , then we could double the lifespan s lifespan . Of course it would save more money .
Well , to close , I can tell you that we 've created a kind of steel material that uses steel , add up to a steel , and to actually increase the lifespan of the road , which is something that even you can do , Tar twice the lifespan with very simple tricks .
Now you may be wondering whether it works .
We also have the prototype here . It s pretty warm .
It should have been a little cooler before , and I just showed you the effectiveness of the scaffolding .
But let me try that .
See that . Yeah , it s sticky .
Thank you .
I 'm here today to talk about a puppet question which the answer is confused .
The theme is the secret of family violence , and the question I ask is the question people always ask : Why is she staying there ?
Why should women stay with people who beat them ?
I 'm not a psychiatrist , not a social worker or a domestic expert .
I 'm just a woman who wants to share my story .
At the time I was 22 , I graduated from Harvard .
I moved to New York City when I was first writing and editorial for Seventh magazine .
For the first time , I had my own apartments , my own American Express , and I had a big secret .
The secret is , this gun was loaded with a bullet in my head by a man I thought to be a mate , ever again .
My man loved more than all the guns in my head and threatened to kill me every time I could n't remember .
I 'm here to tell you about crazy love , a psychological trap cap that millions of women and even some men have every year .
This could be your story .
I 'm not like a domain of foreign fighters .
I have an English gesture in Harvard , and the marketing of marketing from Wharton business .
I 've run out of work for companies in the top-500 of America like Johnson and Johnson , Leo Burnett and the Washington Times .
I married my second husband for almost 20 years and had three children .
My dog is like the Black Lab , and I drive Honor Odyssey .
So the first thing I want to tell you is that domain violence happens to everybody , every religious , every religion , every level of income and education .
It happens everywhere .
And the second thing I want to talk about is that people think that violence happens to women , that s a matter of issue .
It s not true .
Over 85 percent of the violent men are men , and the domestic violence that only happens in intimacy , constraints , long , long-term , family , where we ultimately want or wait for landmines to see violence .
I said to myself , I 'm the other person on Earth with the man who beat me , but in fact , I 'm a typical victim .
I 'm only 22 years old , living in the United States , women from 16 to 24 who are three times more likely to become a victim of domestic violence compared to other women in other ages , and over 500 women and girls in this age are killed every year by violent offenders , son , and her husband in the United States .
I was also a typical victim because I had no idea about domestic violence , warning signals or patterns .
I met with Connor one night , rain and cold .
He sat next to me in the New York City tunnel , and he caught me with me .
He told me two things .
One was that he , like me , graduated from Ivy League , and that he worked at a very impressive bank in Wall Street .
But the most dramatic thing with me at the meeting was that he was smart and he looked like a little farmer .
He had these big little buffers , big apples , big apples , like a big wheat field , and he looked so sweet .
One of the smartest things that Connor did , since the beginning , was to create a hallucination that I was a promising partner .
He did this all the way back in the first place by embracing me .
We started dating , and he fell in love with me every day that I was smart , that I chose to go to Harvard , that I was very excited to help new girls and work .
He wanted to know everything about my family and about my childhood , my hopes and dreams .
Conflict believed me , as a writer and a woman in a way that no one had .
And he also created the incredible atmosphere of our truths by adding his secrets , that , as a child from the age of four , was absurd for itself , and it was repeating his father , and it was repeatedly bad for him to leave school , and the perseverance of interest , and the perseverance was bad for him to leave school , although he was very smart and he died almost 20 years to rebuild his life .
That explains why Ivy Leave and his work at Wall Street and his bright future of illumination means significant to him .
If you tell me that the smart , funny man , my beloved one day , then I get a page or not , and my skirt is short , where I live , where I work , and where I 'm a dear friend and where I 'm a Christmas , I 'll laugh at you because there s no piece of violence or if there s no bad at all .
I did n't know that the first stage in any domain of domestic violence was tempting and sexy .
I also did n't know that the second phase was the victim .
Now , Conor did n't come home one day and announced , Hey , you know , all the Romeo and this juvenilbox were great , but I needed to move on to the next phase where I isolation her — so I had to take her out of this apartment where the neighbors would hear her scream and go out of the city where the neighbors had her friends and all the family members could see things .
Instead , Connor was he going home on a Friday night , and he told me that he had to spend his dream today , and he said , He quit my job because I , because I 'm so honored that he does n't need to show me that he does n't need to prove himself in Wall Street , and he just wanted to leave this town and he just wanted to go out of the town in New England .
Now , the last thing I want to do is I left New York and my dream , but I thought you had to sacrifice your life , so I agreed and my work and my work , Connor I left Manhattan .
I did n't think that I 'd worked on a crazy love , that I was walking the first step into a psychological trap , money , that I was going to be careful .
The next step in this violent scenario is to get into the threat of violence and see how she responds .
From here , the guns come in .
When we moved to New England -- you know , where Connor was it on to feel safe -- he bought three rivers .
He kept a tree in the container of our car .
A lamp beneath our bed nets , he s always in the middle of the wallet .
And he said that he needed these guns because of the traumatic damage that he had experienced in the past as a child .
He needed them to feel protected .
But the gun actually was a message for me , and although he had n't given my arms to me , my life was in danger of every single day .
Connor attacked me the year before our wedding remarks .
It was about seven o'clock in the morning when I was in my sleeve .
I was laying on the roof , trying to get into my interference , and I was depressed , Connor to use my frustration to get two hands around me , and scrambling around me , and I could n't breath or yelling , and he was using my mind to the walls at the same time .
Five days later , 10 bruises on my wristwatch , and I dressed my mother s dress , and I married him .
Though what happened , I still am sure we were going to live happily because I fell in love with him and he loved me a lot .
And he was very sorry .
He was really stressed out because the wedding and the married of my family .
It was a solitude , and he would never hurt me .
It happened twice in the honeymoon .
For the first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I was lost , and he was very strong , and I was beaten up on the head of my head , and it was really hard for my head to knock on the door .
A few days later , driving home after the honeybee , he was tired of the car , and he threw the Big Mac in my face .
Conception to me once twice a week for two months and half a year since marriage .
I was wrong to think that I was the only case , and I was alone in this .
A third of American women went through domain of domestic violence or stalking at some of their lives and reported that 15 million children were abused each year , 15 million .
So I was really in a really good company .
Back to my question : Why am I here ?
The answer is very easy .
I did n't know he was in charge of me .
Even he put me on my head , and he pushed me down on the floor , threatened my dog , took a lock out of the car while I was driving in the highway while I was in my head when I was wearing my book for the interview , I had never thought once I had a chance to do it .
Instead , I 'm a strong woman in love with a man who has a problem , and I 'm the only person on Earth can help Connor to confront his ugly self .
The other question people ask is , why did n't she leave ?
Why did n't I walk ? I could go any time .
For me , it was the sadness and most painful question , because we , the victims know something that you often do n't know : it s a terrible thing to leave you with .
Because the last step in the domain s violence was killing her .
Over 70 percent of the domain of domestic violence happened after the victims ended up having sex , after she left , because then the violence had gone wrong .
But the other consequence was being watched for a long time , even after the abuse of marriage ' to come from financial resources ' and to lobbies of the entire family in order to terrify the victims and the children of her children , these children are often constrained by the judgment of the courts of the time that the men had been watched their mothers .
And we go , why did n't she let it go ?
I was able to quit , because a cruel cried me .
I realized that the man I had loved would kill me if I left him .
So I broke my silence .
I tell people , murder , neighboring , my friends and family , who are totally exotic , and I 'm standing here today because you are helping me .
We have this idea of victims as scary headlines , women who destroy themselves , good things that hurt us .
The question , Why is she ?
That s the reason for some people , that s her fault as the victim had chosen men with intentions to destroy us .
But since I published Crazy , I 've heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also left , who learned an endless life lesson , but what happened , and who rebuilds life -- happy , funny , mothers -- mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers , life completely without violence , mothers like me .
Because the truth is that I 'm a typical victim of the violence that ended me as a dictionary survivor from my family .
I ended up married with a good , kinky , and we had three children .
I have a Black Lab and I have a van .
What I never had , forever , was a gun in my head , because somebody said he loved me .
At the moment , you may be thinking , Oh , this is amazing , Oh , she s just stupid at all , but all this time , I 've actually been talking about you .
I 'm sure some of you who are hearing me right now are people who are being abused or who have been abused when they 're little or who fought themselves .
Understanding can affect your girlfriend , your best friend , your best friend right now .
I could end my crazy love story by destroying silence .
I 'm shaking my silence today .
This is how I help other victims , and this is my final request .
Let s talk about what you hear here .
The absence was just frightened of silence .
You have the power to end your family simply by shining a light bulb .
We victims need everyone .
We need you to understand the secret of domain violence .
solemn is the absence of today by talking about it with your children , your friends , your friends and family .
Willful your life is like happy , loving people with open future .
Early on , you know , the early signs of violence and the deception of the conscience , it goes down , just for victims to come safe .
Together we can make our bedsores and our families become peaceful and safe .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are about 10 , 000 bird birds in the world .
It s one of the most damaging groups of birds .
When you see a meditation like this , the first thing that happens in your mind is , these are really ugly , ugly creatures , greedy , and just aiming your meat , reluctant .
I want to change that sense . I want to change the feelings that you 're giving for these birds , because they need our compassion . They really need .
Let me tell you why .
First of all , why are they so impressed ?
When Charles Darwin crossed the Pacific in 1832 , from the Beagle , he saw the churches in Turkish , and he said , These birds are very disgusting with the red pole .
You ca n't get worse than that , and these are words Charles Darwin .
You know , You changed your mind when he came back , let me tell you why .
They 've also been linked to Disneglimpse -- personalized , dumb , stupid characters .
More recently , if you 're watching the news in Kenya -- these are the characteristics that connect with the Keya , but I want to resist that .
I want to resist because you know what ?
Because the military does n't keep the environment clean .
Resistance do n't prevent disease from preventing disease .
They could n't institutions a husband .
They were still extinct .
And , what I like most is , the shadows look a lot more .
There are two kind of meditators on this planet .
The kind of World Trade Telescope is found mainly in the United States , like conconconconduit and caracaras adoption , where there are 16 species . In these 16 species , there are 11 species with endangered endangered risk .
So , why is it important ? First of all , they provide essential ecological services . They clean up .
They 're really natural garbage guys .
They clean up dead bodies .
They help kill the bacteria . They help absorb the coal that can spread and cause huge loss of loss to livestock and cause the disease to other animals .
The latest studies have shown that in areas where there are no dead charities that need to be three to four times more time to break down , and the vast result of this is the spread of disease .
It also has a great history of their importance .
They 've been connected to ancient Egyptian culture .
Nekham is the symbol of the defender and mother , and together with the snake , which stands for the agency between Michoir and Mitigation of Egypt .
In Hindu mysterious , Jatayu was a meditation , and he risked life to save the god from the first 10 Ravana .
In Tibet , they make it very important . In places like Tibet , there s no place to bury dead people , or have no fire to fire them , so the metabolism is providing a natural history of waste .
So what s the meditator getting ?
We have eight premature species in Kenya , where six species are threatened with high extinction .
The reason is that they 're poisoned , they 're poisoned because there s great competition between humans and the wildlife community that s using this toxic substance to get into predatory predators but instead , the prey prey is for this victim .
In South Asia , countries like India and Pakistan , four kicks in the list of really high risks that mean they 're only less than 10 or 15 years to reach an absolute extinction and the reason is because they are being treated because they have to be retreated like Dictionary .
This medicine has been banned for medicine in India , and they have shown that .
Because there s no charities , there s a spread of wild dogs in the garbage collection of animals , when you get a wild dog , you have a giant date of cholera . The number of cases has a lot more in India .
Kenya is going to have the largest winner in Africa with 353 engines that will be installed in Lake Turkana .
I 'm not against wind , but we need to work with the government , because the wind that makes the birds look like this , they cut sometimes .
These are chapters .
In West Africa , there s a terrible deadly deadline for the market and brutality .
So what did we do ? We 're working on these birds . We 're putting the signals in them .
We 're trying to define their basic ecology , and track where they come .
We can see them move to a lot of different countries , so if you focus on these problems on a scale , this wo n't work for you .
We need to work with government on the level .
We 're working with local communities .
We 're telling them about respect to honor these wonderful creatures and the benefits that they provide .
How do you help ? You can become an active person , create a voice . You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these micro animals . Love the time .
When you walk out of this room , you get information about the kernels , but tell your family , your neighbor , your neighbor , your neighborhood .
They were so charismatic . Charles Darwin said , He changed the idea that he saw them flying like he did n't need a little bit of power in the sky .
Kenya , this world , will be much , much , if there are n't any great animals .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 years old , I remember one morning that I woke up when I heard the grace in my house .
My father was hearing the BBC on his little radio .
He expanded a big smile , which was unusual because the news often makes him sad .
He s like , The Taliban are gone !
I did n't understand at the time , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
Now you can actually go to school . He said .
One morning I could n't forget .
It s a real school .
You know , the Taliban go to Afghanistan since I was six years old and ban girls to go to school .
Over the next five years , I was dressed as a son to walk with my sister to a secret school because my siblings were banned from their own .
It s the only way that we can go to school .
Every day , we go in different ways so that no one s questioned about our destination .
We were hiding books in the market like this , and people would think we 'd just go shopping .
That school in a house , over 100 children , we squeezed in a small hotel .
Pretty warm in winter , but summer is incredibly hot .
We all know our own lives , our teachers , our parents and our parents .
At some point , the suddenly closed school was about a week because the Taliban doubt .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Can we see it ?
Did they know where we were ?
We were scared , but we still wanted to go to school .
I 'm very lucky to be raised in a family that s very valuable to learning and girls .
My grandfather was a very compact man at the time .
A man who was totally ruined from a forgery in Afghanistan , and he took his daughter , his mother went to school , and so he had his father s father to give up .
But my mother had an educator .
She s right here .
She retired two years ago to use our house to open up her school for girls and women in her neighborhood .
And this is my father s father who was the first person in his family .
No doubt that his children will be educated , including his daughter , his daughter , regardless of the Taliban , and despite the dangers .
For him , females are not taught to be a greater threat .
In the Taliban , I remember that there were times when I was angry about our lives and was always frightened and oblivious and oblivious .
I 'd like to let go of school , but my father , he would say , Look , you can lose everything in your life .
It can be robbed . You can be forced to leave the house in your war in war .
But one thing s going to last for you is the one in here , and if we 're forced to sell blood to obesity , we 're going to do that .
So what else do you want to carry on ?
Today I 'm 22 .
I was raised in a country that had been demolished by decades of war .
Less than six percent of my women had studied after high school , and if my family did n't commit to my education , I also became one of them .
But I 'm proud to stand here as a graduate student in the Middlebury School .
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who had been tortured by his family , dare to let his daughter go to school , was one of the first people I ever had .
He did n't boast about my equity , but also about me being the first woman , and I was the first woman to carry him in the streets in Kabul .
My family believed me .
I dream big , but my family wish for me to be bigger .
So I 'm a global ambassador for 1010 , which is a global movement to educate women .
So I helped the SOLA , the first school , and it was probably unique for girls in Afghanistan , a country that was still dangerous for girls to go to school .
I 'm excited to see my students coming to school with hope to embrace this opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fathers as my dad , supporting them , and even having trouble doing so .
Like Ahmed . It was n't his real name , and I could n't show his face , but Ahmed was my father s father .
Less than a month , he and his daughter are on the way to SOLA from their village , and they 're actually just killed because of a bomb inside just a few minutes .
When he got home , the telephone , the voice threatened him if he kept putting his daughter in school , they would try it again .
And he said , If you want to kill me , but I 'm not going to destroy my daughter s future because of the back-line and vice versa .
Now I 've noticed about Afghanistan , and this is what s often left out in the West , which is behind most successful people , we are a father to value their daughters and to find their children s success as their own success .
This is not important in our success .
In fact , they 're the first person and the persuasion for a future of girls , but in social situations like Afghanistan , we need support for men .
In the Taliban , girls go to school and hundreds of people who remember that , it s illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks very different from the United States .
I found that Americans see vulnerability , fragility in change .
I was afraid that all of those changes would n't last longer after the U . S . army .
But when I went to Afghanistan , when I saw my students in my school and their parents supported them , encouraging them , I saw a future for a long time and a change would last .
For me , Afghanistan is a country of hope , the possibility of not limited , and every day SOLA reminds me of it .
Like me , they had a big dream .
Thank you .
Hello . This is my cell phone .
A mobile phone can change your life , and a phone can also bring you free .
With a mobile phone , you can record an invasion of human rights in Syria .
With a mobile phone , you can also post a message on Tweeter and start joining a protest for government in Egypt .
And also with a telephone , you can record a song , post it to the Soundloud Cloud and become famous .
All of those things can be with your cell phone .
I 'm a child of 1984 , and I live in Berlin .
Let s go back to that moment in the city .
You can see here the way that thousands of people stand up and promote change .
It was the fall in the fall of 1989 , and imagine people who stood up and demanded that there was a mobile phone in their pocket .
Who in the audience has a mobile phone ?
Raise it .
Raise your cell phone , please raise your cell phone !
Raise it . A Android phone , Blackberry , wow .
A lot . Today , most of us have a mobile phone .
But today I 'm going to talk about myself and my phone , and how it changed my life .
I 'm going to talk about that .
There are about 3530 blocks of information .
Simple information .
But why is that information here ?
The reason is that in the summer of 2006 , the European Commission proposed a single official .
It s called The Resilience market .
This is a graph that says that every telecommunications company in Europe , every single Internet service provider across Europe , has to store huge amounts of information about users .
Who s called anybody ? Who sent to anybody ?
Who sent us mobile messages ?
And if you use your mobile phone , this is where the problem is .
All of this information is stored in at least six months , until two years by your Internet you 're using or service provider .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , We do n't want that .
They said , we do n't want this personal archive .
We wanted to have autonomy in the digital age , and we did n't want that telecommunications and Internet service providers restored all of our information .
They 're lawyers , journalists and fathers , all said , We do n't want that .
And you can see on this here , like 10 , 000 people participate in the Berlin streets and corridors of freedom .
And some people even said , it s like Stasi 2 . 0 .
Stasi was the police force in East Germany .
I used to ask myself , is it working ?
Can they record our entire information ?
Every time we use our mobile phone ?
So I asked my grandfather to use it , Deutsche Telementary , who provides the largest telecommunications of Germany at that time , and I asked them , Thank you all my information .
I asked them to send me just once , and I kept asking , but what I got was a clear answer .
But then I said , I want to get this information , because they 're archiving my life .
And I decided that I would send it to the court , because I would like to have this information .
But Deutsche Teleknife said , no , we wo n't give you this information .
And finally , I made a deal with them .
I 'm going to cancel them , and they 're going to give me the information I 'm going to ask .
Because at that time , the federal constitution had defined that the market of the European Union did n't work in the German constitutional system .
So I got this ugly envelope with a CD at the inside .
And on the CD , what I needed was up there .
3830 blocks of information .
First I look at it , and I say , okay , it s a big data file . Good .
But then I realized , this is my whole life .
This is my sixth life in six months , documenting the whole of this data .
And then I wondered , what should I do with it ?
Because I can see where I went there , where I slept every night , what I did .
But then I said , I want to go public this information .
I want it to be known by the public .
Because I 'd like to show people what data really is .
So for Zeit Online Online and Open Data , I did the same .
These are visual images of the lives of the six months that have been documented by my life .
You can zoom in or smaller it , and you can actually tutor it or go backwards .
You can see each step by step .
You may even know how I went to Frankfurne on a train to Cologne , and even the frequency I called the power between those two places .
All of this information can be with this information .
I had a sense of fear .
But that information is not just about me .
It s about all of us .
First , it s just like this , I call my wife and she calls me , we talk to me three times .
And then some friends call me , they call each other .
And then you call it for you , and you call it for you , and you get this broad network of communication .
But you can see how we communicate , they call each other at some point , when they go to sleep .
You can see it all .
You can see the most important parts , like the leaders in a group .
If you have access to this information , you can see how the community works , society .
If you have access to this information , you can control the whole society .
This is a drawing for countries like China or Iran .
This is a way to look at society , because you know who people have talked to people , who have sent emails , all of that if you have access to this information .
And this information is stored in at least six months in Europe , until maybe two years .
As I said in the beginning , imagine if all these guys were in the Berlin Delta , 1989 had a mobile phone in their pockets .
And maybe Stasi would know who s been involved in this demonstration , and if Stasi knew who was the leader behind it , it would never have been possible .
The collapse of the Berlin wall may not exist .
And if that were , probably the collapse of the iron Miracle in the Cold War would n't exist .
Because today , functional agencies and companies want to store information that they get as many as possible , online and online .
They want to be able to track our lives , and because they want to record this information at any point .
Expressive and living in the digital age is not in conflict .
What you should do is fight your freedom today .
And you have to fight it every day .
Then , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and that s not old .
When you go home , just tell your representatives that because companies and organisms can record specific information , even though they do n't have to do that .
And if you do n't trust me , ask the network to feed the information that they stole about you .
So in the future , every time you use your cell phone to remind you that you have to fight for private autonomy in this digital age .
Thank you .
Photography is my passion since I 'm big enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 pictures that I 'm most honored , and I 'm not taking myself one of them .
Without art directions , without a model , did n't even take it , did n't even care about the light .
In fact , most of them were taken by accidents .
The story begins when I went to New York City to participate in a speech and my wife took a picture of me holding my daughter s first birthday , and we stood on a 57 and five .
We happened to go back to New York one year later , so we decided to shoot another one .
You can see where the story is leading .
When I was going to go to my third birthday , my wife said , Why do n't you take Sabrina to New York on a trip that was only a father and daughter , then continue to suspecate ?
We started with visitors on the road .
You know , your camera embodied someone for a whole stranger worldwide in a remarkable way .
No one refused , and fortunately no one left out with our camera .
We had no idea how it was going to change our lives .
It becomes sacred to us .
This was taken a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and I tried to explain what was happening the way that a five year-old child could understand .
These pictures are not just objects that represent a moment , or a particular journey .
They 're the way that we pause for a week in October , thinking about our time and how we changed each year , not just physical , but in the face .
Because while we take the same picture , but our worldview changes , my daughter gets new marked , and I get to see her life through her eyes , how she looks and interact with the object .
The period of time that we spent on this is something that we value and we expect all the years .
Recently , on a journey , we were walking , and my daughter suddenly ended up in the middle of the street , and it just came to this red roof of the magnifier store that it loved as little as we had on our previous journey .
She described to me at the age of five , when he was standing there .
It said that it had been taken out of the cage when it saw that store for the first time .
And now what it sees in New York is universities , because it decided to go to school in New York .
And I realized that one of the most important things we create is memory .
So I 'd like to share this idea of hands-on ideology of creating memories .
I do n't know about you guys , but out of these 15 pictures , I do n't show up very much in families .
I 'm always a photographer .
So today I want to encourage all of you to be in the photo , and do n't take a hurdle to the other person , and ask , Can you take a picture for us ?
Thank you .
I never forgot the words that I found -- she died in exile : Hey , fight back to Gaddafi . fight him .
But never turn into a kind of Gaddafi revolution .
Almost two years has passed since the Khan Academy in Libya , continuously empowered by large actors in a large scale of what are called Tunisia and Egypt .
I joined the forces of Libya and beyond Libya to call it the day of prosperity and to start an initiative to fight the Gaddafi regime .
And that s a great revolution .
The first young men in front of the front line demands to overcome the state , raise free speech , dignity , social justice .
They showed a mirror image of compassion in the face of Gadfi dictator .
They showed that a colony of paint that went from east to west and stretched to the south .
In the end , after six months of war , we managed to release 50 , 000 of us managed to liberate our country and to overcome the tyranny .
However , Gaddafi left a burden , a legacy of the institution , corruption and mundane tubes .
Over the last four decades , Gaddafi regime has destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture of Libya society .
The consciousness of the destruction and the challenge , I also , like many other women , the rebuilding of Libya s civil society , is going to call it full and transit to the democracy and the nation-state .
Nearly 200 organizations were founded in Benghazi during that time , and soon Gaddafi collapsed -- nearly 300 in Tripoli .
After 33 years of uprootheism , I went back to Libya , with the most enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiasm , and I started to organize people on leadership .
Same group of women , I co-founded Libya Women for the Resistance of the women , leaders from every other part of society , in order to lobster social empowerment for women and to advocate for our rights to participate .
I was in a very difficult situation when the money went elected , which was a very polarized environment , an environment formed by a political , political perspective .
I led an initial initiative by the Libya Women for the Resistance to lobbye for a more inclusive election rule , which would bring every citizen , no matter what they came up with , elected and elected , and most importantly were set the regulations for the political parties to give the candidates to the candidates and women along the way to the list their list .
At the end , our initial initiative was also adopted and successful .
The women won 17 and five percent of the national Council in the first election of the 52 years .
However , little by bit , the excitement of the general election cycle and of the general revolution disappeared -- as we go through day and wake up with the violence .
One day we woke up with the news about the invention of the ancient almonds and the burden of the Sufi people .
The other day we woke up with news about the American mission of assault and attacking attacks .
The other day we woke up with the trust of the military officials .
And every day , we wake up with the rule of military force and their continuity to be human rights with prisoners and their incarceration on incarceration as well .
Our society , our form of communications , became more polarized and left far away from the ideals , of freedom , of dignity , of dignity that we pursued at the beginning .
Notice no , except , and the newspaper becomes the symbol of the creation .
I 've got no intentions to inspire you with the success story of creating the course list and the elections .
And I 'm here to admit that we -- the whole country has made the wrong choice .
We did n't prioritize civil rights .
Because elections do n't bring peace , stability or security for Libya .
Is the list and the fermentation between the male candidates and the women that bring peace and reconciliation to the country ?
No , no .
So what does it ultimately help ?
Why is it that our society continues to be a polarization and dominated by the selfish politics of dominance and eliminating , by both men and women ?
Maybe missing is not just about feminism ' it s about feminism ' it s about feminism ' it s about tolerance , tolerance , total tolerance .
Our society needs a national dialogue and a more constructive cohesive rather than having elections , which only enhances polarization and separation .
Our society needs more qualities from women than needs numbers and quantities of gender .
We need to stop acting like crazy assignment , stop advocacy .
We need to start acting as the ambassadors of compassion and tolerance .
We need to develop a feminist conversation not just to honor , but to really practice instead of hatred , collaborating instead of competing , instead of competing .
These are the necessary ideas that a country has been defeated like Libya desperately needed to be able to carry peace .
Because of peace as a memoir , it needs erotic resonance , which is interweaving between men and women .
That s the real key .
And we need to set up the survival element before we do it in terms of politics .
According to a poem in the Salam of Salam -- peace -- which is the word of God longing to tolerance , rape .
Next , from rahelium was known in the traditions of Abraham , the source is rape -- the expression of female circumcision -- where women and women , from all walks of life , from all tribal tribes , are born .
And because the supply is completely developing in itself , the sacred matrix of cultivating the whole life .
So we 've been taught that our tolerance has covered up .
So we 've been taught that our tolerance is a huge amount of anger .
May we each have the grace of tolerance .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I experienced something a little bit like Alice in Xi .
Penn State Penn asked me , a teacher who taught me to communicate a course for the students .
I was scared .
It was really fearless . It was fearless students , big books and exotic languages .
But when the discussions opened , I experienced something that Alice went through when she fell down the rabbit and found the door to a new world .
That s just what I felt when I was talking to my students , and I was amazed by their ideas , and I wanted others to be experience that .
I believe the key to the world is a good ability to communicate .
We 're desperately going to need to be able to communicate with scientists and engineers to change the world .
Scientists and engineers are the ones who are confronting with the biggest challenges , from energy to the environment , and so on , if we do n't know and do n't understand that , then it s not going to be done , and I believe our responsibility , who are not professionals , who are interacting with them .
But the exchange conversations ca n't happen if scientists and engineers do n't invite us into their own workplaces .
As scientists and engineers , eight stories with us .
I 'd like to share some myths to do so to make sure we find your science is sexy , sexy .
The first question is : What ?
Why does science relate to us .
Do n't just say that he studies bone , but let s say he studies bone tissue , it s like grid-level nets that make our bones , because we need to know about bone disease and treatment .
When you describe science , be careful with the term .
The language prevented us from understanding your ideas .
Sure , you can say , spatial and good work , but you do n't use and you do n't .
To make it easy to understand not to lower them .
Instead , like the Axis said , turning things as simple as possible , but do n't simpler .
Clearly you could talk about scientific problems without getting any idea .
So I 'm interested in telling you stories , telling stories , and I think these are ways to engage and make us excited what you say .
And when you say , do n't use the headlines .
Have you ever wondered why they called them the headline ?
What if the brick were the brick ? The ice was the eradication , killing always ! and they would kill your talk .
One slide like this , not mundane , but too much to the brain s brain , that makes us suspicious .
Instead , this example of Genedicve Brown s example really understands that the structure of the tissue is so special that it actually inspires the unique design of the Tower .
And the trick here is using simple and easy sentences that people can rely on if they do n't keep up , and then use the visual imagery to help us get a deeper understanding .
I think these are just a few secrets that let us open that door and see the god of science and technology .
The engineers that I worked with had to know had to suck me down . So I just want to summarize it with a equation .
You take the science except for the line and the term , and then you share the probability of the audience , and then the person with the passion you 're doing , and then the result will result in that will be a complete interactive interaction .
And therefore , as scientists and engineers , when you solve this equation , with every single price , let s say eight stories to me .
Thank you .
Hello . I 'm Cameron Russell , and in the short run , I 'm a model .
Actually , in 10 years .
And I felt like there was an uncomfortable pressure in the room at the moment because I should n't wear this one .
Luckily I had a different suit .
This is the first time someone has a tower on the TED stage , so I think you 're very lucky to see this .
If a couple of women were so scared when I came out , you did n't have to tell me where to go , but then I 'll just go through Twitter .
I realized I was very lucky to change what you thought I was in 10 seconds of comfort .
Not everybody has the opportunity to do this .
These high-heeled shoes are very uncomfortable , and I 'm not going to take them .
The worst part is this long hat on top , because every single person laughed me , so do n't do anything when it was above my head .
All right .
Why did I do that ?
It s weird .
Actually , hopefully it s not so odd .
It s very powerful , but it s also very fake .
I 've just changed completely what you think about me in six seconds .
And in this image , I actually have n't had any boyfriend in my life .
I was very uncomfortable at that moment , and photographed me to use my back and put my hands on his hair .
And of course , unless the operation , or the scathed of sunshine that I had two days ago to photograph , was very few things that we could do to change our appetite , and it looks aligning , even though it s prosthetics and it s hard to change , it has a huge impact on our lives .
So today , for me , it does n't matter what it means to be true .
And I 'm standing on this stage because I 'm a prototype .
I 'm standing on this stage because I 'm beautiful , white , and in the model , we call it a sexy girl .
And I 'm going to answer the questions that people still ask me , but with the truth .
The first question is , how do I become a sample ?
And I always say , Oh , I 've been discovered , but it does n't mean anything .
Actually I 'm a model because I win the lottery population , and I 'm a inherent property , and maybe you 're wondering what the inheritance is .
In the past decade , we 've defined beauty not just as healthy and young and neutral and symmetry that we 've learned about the biology to aspire , but height , dark lines and women , and white .
This is what the legacy was built for me , and that s the legacy I earned because of it .
I know some of you are skeptical this , and maybe there are some people in the dress like , Waste . Naomi Smali . Liberal Smalls . Liberen Wen Wen . Wen Wen . Wen .
I want to praise your understanding of the sample . It s very impressive .
But unfortunately I have to tell you that in 2007 , a Ph . D . student at the University of New York had statistics for all the people on the floor , and in 67 , that there were only 27 , less than four percent , not white .
The next question people always ask me is , Can you become a model when you 're growing up ?
And my first answer was , You know , you do n't know , you do n't have to recruit .
But the next answer I really want to talk to girls is , Why ?
You know ? You can become anyone .
You can become President of the United States , or the founder of the next Internet , or a cardiac surgeon , which is great , because you 're going to be the first person to do it .
If , after a very interesting list , they kept saying , No , no , Cameron , I want to be the model , and I 'll say , Put your boss .
Because you do n't have any power ' you can also be the sum of the Voice in the United States or the CEO of the H & M , or Steven Meisel .
Tell me that you want to be a model when you grow up like you want to win the lottery when you grow up .
It s beyond your control , and it s great , but it s not a career path .
I 'm going to prove to you -- with 10 years of experience , I 'm accumulating as being a sample , because it does n't look like a cardiac surgeon , so it just takes a very short time .
If photographer is still here and the light is there , like a beautiful interaction , and when the client says , Cameron wanted to take a step , so this leg goes in front , and this leg walks back , and this arms paw it back , and this introduces , the three quarters , and you just go back , and back , you just go back , and forth , and then you go back , and then you go back , and then you think your friends , 500 , 500 , 500 , 500 , 500 times .
Like this .
The hope is that it s less than the picture in the middle .
I did n't know what happened in the meantime .
Sadly after you 're finished , you write a couple of things and you do something , you ca n't say something else , because if you want to be President of the United States , but your soccer model says , 10 years , people look at you with strange eyes .
The next question people always ask me is : Is all the images edited right ?
That s right , almost all the photos are edited , but that s just a small element of what s going on .
This was one of the first images that I ever photographed , which was the first time I photographed a bathroom , and I even had a menu cycle .
I know we 're going into the personal story , but at the time I 'm a little girl .
This was my appetite , took my grandmother back a few months .
This is me in the same day when I photographed this photo .
My best friend walked with me .
This is me at a bedtime party a few days ago when I photographed the French December .
This is me with the football team in the V . C .
And here I am .
I hope you can see -- the pictures are not my image .
These are the images built , and it was built by a group of professionals , hairstyles , hairstyles , photographers , photographers , and innovators and all their assistants , money and manufacturers , and they built this . That s not me .
The next question I get is : What are you for free ?
I have a lot of high heights that I never got , when I was excepted , exceptional to , but all the free stuff that I got was in my life , and that s what we do n't want to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and then I went to the store , and I forgot to bring it to him for free .
When I was a teenager , I was in a friend s car , and she was a very fearless driver and she 'd crossed the red , and all I did was say , Sorry the police , and we could go on .
I got those free things , because of my appearance , not who I am , and who I have people who are ready to spend a lot of money on their appearance , not who they are .
I lived in New York , and last year , in 140 , 000 teenagers were arrested , there were 86 percent black and Roman , mostly young people .
In New York , there are only 177 , 000 black and Hidden people , so for them , the question is not , are I caught ?
It s how many times am I going to get caught and when ?
When I was preparing for this talk , I discovered that 53 percent of the 13 year-old girls do n't like their bodies , and this number came up to 78 percent when they were 17 .
The last question that people ask me is , how do you feel when you 're a sample ?
I think what they want to hear is that if you 're a little bit thinner , and your hair is more happy , you 're going to be happy and happy .
Whereas when we were behind the chicken wing , we gave the idea of something like this .
It s wonderful to travel , and work with creative , inspirational , enthusiastic people .
And that s true , but that s only half , because what we never said in the lens , which I never said before , is : I am insecure .
I was insecure because I had to think about my image every day .
And ever ask yourselves if you 're squeamish yourself and your hair is more happy , would you ever be happier ?
You just have to meet a group of people , because they have the best legs , the most durable hair and the most beautiful , and they may be the most insecure women on the planet .
When I was writing this talk , I felt very hard to find the truth , because on the one hand , I was very uncomfortable to say , I had all these things because I was lucky , and I was so fortunate to follow the following sentence , but it did n't always make me happy .
But mostly it s harrowing a sexual legacy of sex and ethical issues while I 'm one of the greatest beneficiaries .
But I 'm also pleased and honored by this , and I thought it was lucky that I 'd come before 10 , 20 or 30 years on , and I 've worked with a lot of my career , because I could n't tell how I got my first job , or maybe I wo n't talk about how I 'm going to have money , which is important .
If there s something that throws out in this talk , I hope it s all more comfortable to admit that in acknowledging the power of the image in our success and our failure .
Thank you .
There are many , many ways around us that can help improve our lives .
We do n't touch every person , so there s a lot of intelligence that has never been heard , even though we share public spaces .
So over the past few years , I 'm trying more ways to share with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like paperwork , paper and excitement .
And these projects came from the question I asked , like , how much would my neighbor pay for their apartments ?
How do we borrow and borrow more things without knocking on each other s door at a time ?
How do we share more of our memories of abandoned buildings , and get a better understanding of our landscape ?
And how do we share more of our hopes for empty goods , so our communities can reflect our needs and our dreams today ?
Now , I 'm living in New Orleans , and I 'm in love New Orleans .
My soul has always been slowed down by oiled trees , and it s been wrapped up in love , who are drunk and dreaming for hundreds of years , and I believe in the city that s always creating music for music .
I felt the same like every time someone had a choreographer , New Orleans .
Cities have some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but they also have the largest number of what s out of the United States .
I lived around this house , and I thought , how can I make it a better place for my neighborhood , and I also think about something that can change my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost one of my very loved ones .
Her name was Joan , and she was a mother for me , and her death was unpredictable and unintended .
And I 've been thinking about death a lot , and this makes me feel so deep in the times that I 've had , and that gives clarity to my life now .
But I fought to maintain this vision in my everyday life .
I feel like it s really easy to grasp through day , and I forget what it means to actually mean by you .
So with the help of my old friends and new , I move on to the side of this abandoned building into a giant chamber chamber and stereotypes it with a bulky question : Before I die , I want anyone to pick up a piece of pollen , reflect their life , and share their desire for their own personal hope in public space .
I did n't know what to expect from this trial , but the next day , the wall was completely covered , and it continued .
And I want to share something about what people write on that wall .
Before I die , I wanted to try and steal .
Before I die , I wanted to be on the footprints of International .
Before I die , I wanted to sing for millions of people .
Before I die , I wanted to grow a tree .
Before I die , I wanted to live outside of the magic .
Before I die , I wanted to hold her again .
Before I die , I wanted to be somebody s cavalry .
Before I die , I wanted to be totally myself .
So this concrete space became an open space , and the hope and the dreams of people making me laugh , the tears , and they comfort me throughout my tough time .
It s about knowing that you 're not alone .
It s about understanding the people around us in new and shining ways .
It s about creating space for reflection and experience , and remember what really matters to us when we grow up and change .
So I did this project last year , and I started getting hundreds of letters from people who wanted to be a wall in their community , so my central colleagues , and I 'm doing a tool , and now the walls are being done in the world , including Kazakhstan , South Africa , Auzatic , Australia , Austrian and more .
Together , we 've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we 're given the chance to have a voice and share more with each other .
Two most important things that we have are time and relationships with other people .
In the age of increasing our dispersants , this is more important than ever to find ways to maintain a way to look and remember that life is short and soft .
What is dying is something that we 're often not encouraged to talk about or even think about , but I 've been realizing that being prepared to die is one of the most powerful things you can do .
Think about dying your life .
Our spaces can be better than reflect what happens to us as individuals and as a community , and in many ways to share hope , fear and stories and stories , around us not only can help us make better places , they can lead us to lead our lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , I did the math problem , and this is a very unusual problem for anyone doing the math math math math math , which is that we 're like managers .
Nobody knows what we do .
So today I 'm going to try and explain to you what I do .
Well , dancing is one of the things people normally do .
We love the great dancers of the Three Law and the Seven taff you 'll notice later .
balancing is a special level of expertise and high-skill that can be relevant to this whole discipline of genetics .
Sadly , brain disorder progresses like Parkinson s disease progressively destroying this unique capability , which is what s happening to my friend Jan Spling , who , once , has been a trivia three-master artist .
Throughout the last few years there has been tremendous improvement in treatment .
However , 6 . 3 million people globally have diseases , and they have to live in debilitating , shaking trepidation , and other symptoms that go along with this disease . What we need are tools to identify disease before we get too late .
We need to measure progress in a more objective way , and finally , the only way that we know when we actually have a treatment , is when we have a right approach to be able to answer .
But depression is that with Parkinson s and other movement disorders , they do n't have a biological marker , so there s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best one we have is this neurological test .
You need to go to hospitals to do it . It s very expensive , which means that this test is outside of clinical trials , which has never been done .
But what if the patient could do this at home ?
It would be really free to go into the clinic , and if the patient could even do it itself , then what ?
It does n't cost us any time .
It s only about 300 dollars . To do this at the clinic in the clinic .
So what I 'm going to propose to you is a non-traditional way that we can achieve this , because as you can see , at least in some way , we are all prime teachers like Jan Stripling of mine .
So here we have a video of what the bars are doing .
This barometer is healthy and someone is saying , and we can see ourselves as ballet dancers , because we have to work together all the organisms that produce sound , and all of us actually have genes for it . For example , Foxidants .
Like three goats , it needs to be trained .
I mean , think about how long it took a child to talk .
From sound , we can actually track where the vibrations are going , when the limb is affected by Parkinson s , the acoustics .
So in the lower graph , you can see an example of the vibration of the grip .
We see all the same symptoms .
We see our trepidation , our debilitating and rigid .
The words become more depressed and more wind after a while , and that s one of the symptoms of it .
These sound effects can be really difficult , in some cases , in some cases , but with any digital mic , and using the standard software analytics that combine the newest knowledge that we now determine which people say in the circuitry between health and disease use only by using the signals .
So how do these trials be based on the voice compared to the level of expertise versus the clinical trial ? They 're both not interfering each other .
The experience of neuroscience is not invasive . They 're all using existing infrastructure .
You do n't have to design a whole new hospital to do this .
And they 're both right . But one more thing , experiment , experiment based on the voice that does n't have expertise .
That means it can be done on its own .
Skeptical speed , it only takes about 30 seconds to be maximum .
Very low cost , and we all know what happens .
When something becomes extremely cheap , it gets popular .
So these are some of the great targets that I think we can do right now .
We can make it difficult for patients .
It does n't have to go to a clinic .
We can actually do this at a high frequency to get data targeted .
We can do a bunch of workshops with low cost to do clinical trials , the evaluation on population is feasibility for the first time .
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first biomass of the disease before it s too late .
So in order to do the first steps towards this , we 're making the base of the Parkinson s voice .
With Acumber and Patientsi LikeMe , we aimed to recording the voice with a very large number of global data to collect enough data and to process four .
We have local residents that are accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Anybody who s healthy or has Parkinson s disease can call to cheap , and to leave it to a few cents each time , and I 'm really happy to announce that we 've got six percent target in eight hours .
Thank you .
Tom Rielly : So Max , by taking all the samples for 10 , 000 people , can you tell who s healthy and who s healthy ?
What do you conclude from these samples ?
Max Little : Yeah . Well what happens is , when you call it , you have to know if you have a disease .
See , some people can not do that . Maybe they do n't call it .
But we 're going to take a huge amount of data that s collected from all of these different cases , and the results are in different cases because then we 're going to look at what are going to do , and find the actual signs of this disease .
So now , 86 percent ?
More than that .
Actually , my student Thanasis , I have to praise him , because he did some amazing work , and he proved that this was able to go through mobile phones , which allowed this to work , and the point was exactly 99 percent correct .
Ninety-nine . Yeah , a big improvement .
So that means that people will be able to -- people can call it from their mobile phone and do this test , and people with Parkinson s disease can call them , record their voices , and then physicians can check their own evolution , see their health condition as they get sick .
Exact .
Thank you very much . Wan Max of Max Little people .
Thank you very much , Tom .
I live in the South .
This is the South Central : wine , fast food , wildlife .
So the city planners come together and they define the name of the south to make it different , so they change the south in Los Langeles as if it s going to solve the real problems that are actually happening in the city .
This is south of Los Angeles .
Half of wine , fast food , dirty land .
Just like 26 . 5 million Americans , I live in a food desert , in Los Angeles , the house of the school district served food quickly on the road and the accident and ran .
What s interesting is that fast food on the road is killing more people than accidents and running .
In southern Los Angeles , people are dying of treatable diseases .
For example , obesity in my neighborhood is about five times higher than Beverly Hills , which is about 16 kilometers away .
I 'm bored to see this happening .
And I wondered , how do you feel when there s no good food for your health , when every time you have to see the bad things that the food system does ?
I saw a wheelchair bought like the old car .
I see blood filters growing up like Starbucks .
And I realized it had to stop .
I realized that the problem is the solution .
Food is a problem and food is also a solution .
And also , I was very tired of driving 45 minutes with just getting an apple in the air .
What I did is I planted a food forest in front of the house .
It s on a landline of what we call the street .
It s over 300-centimeter long .
The problem is , that land belongs to town .
But you have to keep it .
So I thought , Great . I can do what I want , because that s my responsibility and I have to keep it .
And this is how I 'm going to keep that land .
I 'm with my group , blue land , we 're all gathering together and we 're starting to plant food : fruits , you know , nine vegetables .
We 're a group of peoples that share hats , including gardens from many different lives , from every single city in the city , and they 're all voluntary , and everything we do is free .
And the garden , it s beautiful .
Then there was complaints .
The city came to me , and sort of gave me a write-up , asked me to tear down the garden . It was the theme .
And I was like , oh , yeah . Really ?
A bowl of trees because of trees in the ground that people do n't care ?
And I said , Okay . Come here .
Because this is n't the case .
And then the L . A . receiving news , Steve Lopez writes a paper about it , and discusses it , and then one of the members of the L . A . government sending a petition on Change . org , and with 900 letters , we succeeded .
We had a victory in our hands .
That commissioner even called and said that they fought and love what we 're doing .
I mean , come on , why not ?
L . A . leading the United States of the metropolitan area of the medina that owns the city .
They had about 42 , 000 square kilometers of abandoned land .
That s the equivalent of 20 centrifuges .
enough to grow 725 million tomato trees .
How can they not agree ?
Plant a tree will give you 1 , 000 , 10 , 000 seeds .
When the amount of green price is going to give you the same amount of yield for 75 dollars .
That s my belief , when I tell people , let s just grow your own food .
Incredible food is the same as in self-assembly .
I have heritage in the South .
I grew up there . I grew up teaching my sons .
And I 'm not going to make a part of the reality that s created by other people , and I 'm doing it myself .
I 'm an artist .
Machine is my art . I grew up with my work .
Just like a painter , the car for walls , I , I point for lawns , for lawns .
I use the piece of garage , which grows like a fabric , and trees and trees are what I get for that piece of cloth .
You 'll be surprised with what land can do if you turn them into canvas .
You ca n't imagine how great the flowers are , and how they affect people .
So what happened ?
I saw my garden becoming a tool for education , a tool for transformation in my life .
To change your community , you have to change the components of the land .
We 're soil .
You 'll be surprised to see how the kids are affected .
Making garage is the most therapy and the most challenging job you can do , particularly in the inner city .
With that , you also get a thick .
I remember once , there was a mother and a daughter coming in , and it was about 10 : 30 in the evening and they were in my garden , and then I went out and they were really embarrassed .
I thought , oh my goodness , I felt bad because they were there , and I said to them , you know , you know , you do n't have to do that .
This garden is on its way .
I 'm so embarrassed to see people in the neighborhood that I 've been so hungry , and that s just more reinforced for me to do this . People asked me , Fin , are n't you afraid to steal your food ?
I said , Of course I 'm not afraid they 'll steal .
So they 're just on the road .
The whole idea is .
I want them to take them , but at the same time , I want them to get their health back .
There was another time when I was a garden in a homage in Los Angeles .
I had a couple of men , and they helped me , you know , from the van .
The air was fun , and they shared the stories of garden that affected them and they used to grow vegetables with her mother before , and it was great to see this idea that changed them , although for a minute .
So the green land has continued to grow about 20 pieces of gardens .
We 've got about 50 people to dig in , and they 're all voluntary .
If the kids grow their torch , they eat their food .
If they grow tomato , they eat tomato .
But if no one shows them that , if they do n't see the impact of food to the mind and the body , they blindly eat anything that s been put in the face .
I see these young people who want to work , but they 're really busy , I see these little kids with color and they just follow the road , and they 're not going to lead .
With gardens , I see an opportunity that we can guide children to their own community , and there s a sustainable life .
And when we do that , who knows ?
Maybe we can produce George Washington Carver .
But if we do n't change the components of the country , we never do that .
This is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I wanted to build a piece of garden where people could share food .
I want to take away the tennis rats and turn them into a coffee cafe .
Do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about free stuff , because free is not sustainable .
What s interesting about sustainability is you have to maintain it .
I 'm talking about workshops for people , and I 'm pulling kids out of the street , and I 'm giving them joy , joy and honor to build their own food , open for farmers .
What I 'm going to do here is , we 're going to make it really sexy .
I 'd like all of us to become blue , gardeners .
We 're going to change the concept of fiber .
If you 're not a garage , you 're not a shitter .
Making your cabin with the cabin , OK ?
And let s turn it into your weapons .
Basically , if you want to meet me , you know , if you want to meet , do n't call me if you want to sit not on these seats and get involved in meetings where you talk about doing this .
If you want to meet me , go out with your canyons and you grow something .
Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya in Nairobi .
The back is my father s colony , and behind the cows , is the Nairobi , Nairobi .
The Nairobi members of Nairobi are not represented in a large part of the South , which means that wildlife animals like the barbaric horse .
And so predators like lions following them , and these are what the lions do .
They kill us .
This is one of the cows that was killed in the evening , and when I woke up in the morning , I found it dead , and I felt very sad , because that s the only male cow we had .
My community , the Maasai man , believed that we went from heaven with all of our animals and all the land to keep them , which is why we considered them .
So I grew up with lions .
Residents of the Makers who protect us and cattle , were also very concerned about this .
So they killed the lion .
This is one of the six lions that was killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why lions in the Nairobi Country Nairobi have very little .
Every six-year-old boy , six to nine years old , in my community , is responsible to keep my father s cows , and I have to do the same .
So I had to figure out how to fix this problem .
The first idea that I have is a fire , because I think lions are scared .
But then I realized that fire did n't really work , because it even helped lions see the drag .
But I did n't give up . I kept thinking .
And my second idea was to use sampling .
I 've been trying to deceive those lions by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way .
But lions are smart .
They were the first day and they saw the look , and then they came back , but the second day , they came and said that this was n't moving , it was always there .
And then the lion jumps in and killing the livestock .
So one night , I held a cross-section around the cows , and on that day , the lions did n't come .
I discovered that lions are afraid of light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a kid , I had worked in my room all day long , and I even opened my mother s new radio dial , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electricity .
So I took an old automobile . It s a little device that s found in a car , and it helps the car turn out the ball when they want the left or the right . It flashes a flash .
And I got a switch to be able to turn off and turn it on .
And that s a little lamp from the battery .
And I put everything .
As you can see , the solar panel is used to charge the vaccine , and the vaccine is generating energy for the clock . I call it the machinery .
And the lake of the lake makes the lights go off .
As you can see , the bulb moves out , because that s the lightbulb coming in .
And that s how the lights shine light on the lions when they arrive at night .
And the lightbulbs turned off and deception made them think that I was walking around the ovaries , but actually I was sleeping on my bed .
Thank you .
I installed it at my house two years ago , since then , we did n't have trouble with lions .
Her neighbors heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of lion livestock , and she asked me if I could build shadows .
I said , Yeah .
So I put the bulb bulbs . You can see in the back , they 're lightbulbs .
So far , I 've helped build seven families in my community , and they 've all worked .
Now my idea has been used all over Kenya to get rid of other predatory animals , like hyena , and it s also used to threaten the herd from people s farm .
And by this invention , I was very lucky to take the scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , the International Brookheads , and I was really excited about this .
My new environment is currently beginning to help and raise awareness .
Even I brought my friends back to my community , and we put the bulb on the lights for families who did n't have access to it , and I taught them how to build them .
A year ago , I was just a boy in the farm for my father , and I 'd seen airplanes by one day , and I 'd told myself that one day , I 'd get to sit in it .
And I 'm here today .
I had the chance to go here with an airplane for the first time to join TED .
My greatest dream was to become an aircraft engineer and pilots when I grew up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention was saving his father s heritage and lions , we could live together with lions without any conflict .
Asholen . In my language , it means thank you very much .
I do n't know how interesting it is to hear your story .
So I had this scholarship . Yeah .
I 'm making other things .
What s next in your list ?
I 'm going to go to your own invention , and I want to do an electric fence . Mom ?
I knew the fence fence fence was invented , but I wanted to make my own .
I tried , no , I . . . I tried it before , but I stopped because I was electrical .
Richard Turere , I was so different .
We 'll break my grandchildren down the road , our little brother .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
What I did , and what I did vaporized -- my life of the seven years of work in Africa when I was young .
From 1971 to 1977777th -- my grandfather was n't that young -- -- I worked in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Somalia , in collaboration with African countries .
I worked for an NGO , and each project we set up in Africa .
I was so scared .
And by the time that s 21 years old , I think , the Italian Italian , and we 're doing good in Africa .
But instead , we killed everything that we hit .
So the first project , which inspired my first book , Sambei from Zambei , was a project in which the Italian people decided to teach the Zambia .
So we were in southern Zambia with seeds from Italy in a beautiful valley that went down to Zambebei , and we taught people to plant the Italian tomato and the Italian secrets .
Of course , the indigenous people were n't very interested in doing this , so we paid them , and sometimes they arrived .
We were really surprised by the indigenous people , in the valleys of fat like this , no crop .
But instead of asking them why they did n't grow anything , we simply said , Thank you for being here .
It s time to save the Zambia from starvation .
And of course , everything in Africa is good .
We have these amazing tomato sauce . In Italy , a tomato is about as big as this . At Zambia , it s about this size .
It s unbelievably hard , and we said to the Zambia , You know , people are looking at crops like this all too late .
When tomato sauce began , nine , and the red one night , about 200 encrypted codes from under the river and clear clear clear clear clear .
We said to the Zambia , my God , the code !
And people said , Well , that s why we 're not growing anything here .
So why do n't people just tell us before ? Do you ever ask .
I thought there was just every single Italian of the African country , but then when I looked at what the Americans were doing , the British people were doing , the French people doing , and when I saw what they did , I felt there was something proud of their project in Zambia .
Because , you can see , only we can grow codes .
You should look at the crappy stuff -- you should look at the crap that we 've given Africans unsuspected .
You want to read a book , read The Resilience of death , written by Dambisa Moyo , who is a Zambia .
The book was launched in 2009 .
We have been the Western aid countries that have brought the continent of Africa 2 billion U . S . Venus in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you the deadly damage that the fund has caused .
Go find her book .
Reading it from a African woman , the damage that we cause .
The Westerners , like us , are nationalists , religious people , and we have only two ways to treat each other : either .
Two words that you get from the Romantic word , which means your father .
Those two things mean different .
Parting , I treat anyone from any other culture as if they 're my child . I love them too .
Sure , I treat everybody from another culture , like full of mine .
That s why white people in Africa are called the wander , his boss .
I 'm kind of bothered at reading the book , Red and beauty , written by Schute , said , above all , in economic development , if other people do n't need help , let them wear it .
This should be the first principle in aid .
The first commandment on aid is respect .
This morning , the organizers put a stick out the floor , and said , Can we take this -- imagine a new city without a new democracy ?
When 27 years old , I decided to just affect people , and I created a system called Enterprise , where you 're not going to start anything that you 're never going to motivate , but becoming a beloved person , longing to the longing , loving people of dress who want to be a better person .
So you make your hand -- you quiet .
Never bring a community together with ideas , you sat with the indigenous people .
We did n't work from offices .
We met at the cafe . The cafes .
We have no infrastructure .
And what we do is we become your friends , and figure out what one person wants to do .
The most important thing is desire .
You can give someone an idea .
If someone does n't want to do it , then how do you do it ?
The woman s desire to develop is the most important thing .
The male-pattern for men is the most important thing .
And we helped them go into understanding , because nobody in the world could succeed alone .
Now , people with uncertain ideas have been completely unconscious , but the knowledge is always present .
So many years ago , I had this idea : Why do n't we , just once , go to a community , and tell the people there what to do , why do n't we , listen to them just once ? But not in meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There s a problem in public meetings .
Businesses never go to work , and they have no life to let you know , in the community , what they want to do with their own money , which is the opportunity they 've discovered .
So the plan has this blind spot .
The most wise people in the community have never known because they 're not going to go to public meetings .
What we do is one-on-one work ethic and to do that , you have to create a social structure that does n't exist .
You have to create a new discipline .
A new profession is like a family doctor for business , a family for work , who sat with you in your house , at a coffee table , and helped you find resources to transform your desires into a way of living .
I started as an experiment in Espera , Australia .
I was in a philosopher at the time trying to get away from the way to say goodbye is to come and tell you what to do .
So what I did in the first year in Esperance was just the encyclopedia on the road , and in the three days I had the first client , A hobbies in the car , called Maori , and I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth , and organize work , and then one of the people who found me and said , Can you help me ?
And I helped these guys know how to work together and sell these tuna not for a box at Albany at the Albany , but we found a way to sell it to Japan for 15 dollars , and then the farmer looked at it , and the farmers said , Hey , did it help us ?
In one year , I 've got 27 following and following the government to come up and ask me , How do you do ?
He did that -- and I said , I did something very hard .
I shut them down , and I listen to them .
So — So the government told me , Keep doing it .
We did that in 300 communities around the world .
We helped start 40 , 000 jobs .
There s a new entrepreneurial generation of people who are exhumed for isolation .
Peter Drucker , one of the great management consultants in history , died when he was 96 , a couple of years ago .
Peter Drucker is a philosophical professor before working with business , and this is what Peter Drucker says , This is what Peter Drucker does n't really like with a society and a business economy .
Hospital was a death kiss for entrepreneurs .
So what you 're doing right now is you 're remaking the situation where you do n't know what the most wise people in New Zealand want to do with their money and their potential .
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you .
You have to give them the security , privacy , you have to be really excited about helping them , and they 're going to go , in the crowd of hands .
With a community of 10 , 000 people , we can have about 200 clients .
Can you imagine a community of 400 , 000 people , intelligence and desire ?
What s the most dramatic part of this morning ?
The indigenous people , the craving people . That s the people you clap for .
So what I 'm talking about is Tibet that it s present .
We 're at the very last stage of the early industrial revolution -- with the resources and the productive resources , we have unsustainable systems , we have unsustainable systems .
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
Fresh Freon to store things that are unsustainable .
What we have to look at is how to grow , treat , education , education , movement and communication to seven billion people in a sustainable direction .
No technology can do that .
What an NGO would invent the technology for the green revolution ? Forget !
Government ? Forget !
It s going to be anonymous , and they 're doing it right now .
There s a great story that I read in a magazine many years ago .
There s a group of experts invited to discuss the future of New York City in 1860 .
And in 1860 , the gathering group of people came together , and predicted what was happening to New York City in the next 100 years , and the most consentive conclusion was this : New York City will no longer exist in the next 100 years .
Why ? Because they looked at the curve and they said , if the population kept expanding this ratio , to move a population of the population of New York , they would need to take six million horses , and the waste from six million horses would n't have a way to do it .
They 're going to be overwhelmed in horses .
So in 1860 , they saw this sort of immersive technology that made life in New York City .
So what happened ? In the ' 40s , until 1900 , in the United States , there was about 1 , 001 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 001 company .
The idea of finding a different technology is completely different above all , and there are very small factories in the wrong situation .
Dearn , MIgan . Henry Ford .
However , there s a secret to working with entrepreneurs .
First of all , you have to give them security .
No , they wo n't go and talk to you .
Then you have to give them an absolute service , particularly enthusiastic and passionate service .
And then you have to tell them the truth about business .
The youngest company , the biggest company , has got to have three wonderful things : The product that you want to sell has to be the best , you have to have the ultimate exorbitant strategy , and you have to have the perfect financial governance .
Think about that ?
We 've never met an individual in the world , who has just been able to make it , sell it and manage it at the same time .
That does n't exist .
This creature has never been born .
We did a study , and we looked at 100 companies around the world Carnegie , Watch , Edison , Ford , all new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There s only one thing that every successful company in the world that has , one thing is : No one begins with one .
We 're now teaching business as a 16-year-old , at Norage Normberland , where we started giving them the first two first documents of Richard Branson , and the work for these 16-year-old jaw-dropping jellyfish is under the front page , in the first page of Richard Branson , how many times Richard Branson uses Richard Branson from me and how many of us were using .
Never got from me , and from us , we have 32 times .
He did n't start alone .
He started a company . Nobody .
So we can create a community where there are donors who have the bailouts of small business sitting in a coffee shop , in cafes , and your friends dedicated to making them talk about who they are . Somebody asks you , what do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you do it ?
okay , can you sell it ? Can you maneuver ?
Oh , no , I ca n't do this . Do you want me to find somebody else for you ?
We activate communities .
We have aid groups that are going to help Enterprise Facious , and they 're going to look for resources and people , and we discovered that the miracle magic of people is something like you can challenge the culture and the economy of this community by just holding your desperate , energy and imagination as your people .
Thank you .
Until March three , 2011 , I was a photographer in New York City .
We 're green creatures .
It s hidden in the darkened room , and it s generally avoidable the sun .
We 've got people who are more skinny , more beautiful , that can not be possible , and we 've always got critical criticisms in the press , but we also have brilliant artists with years of experience and photography .
In November 2011 , I was watching the world s situation at home , and I saw tragic events that happened in Japan .
Then , the volunteer , I joined All Volunteers , and over the course of the couple of days went to the effort to respond .
I , along with hundreds of volunteers who could n't just sit at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On May 13th , I found my way to the town of funkoto .
It s a small village of Iwate , with about 50 , 000 people , one of the first places to be affected by the tsunami .
The level of water is recorded in more than 24 meters , and it goes three miles deep in the land .
So imagine , the town was shocked .
We pull the pieces from the channel , the tunnel .
Close the schools , the bathroom , ready for innovation and recovery .
We cleaned up tons of crushing fish and rested from the local factories .
We leverage it , but everyone s happy .
For weeks , volunteers and people were looking for something .
They search for photos and albums and SSD cards .
All of them do .
They 've collected and they 've dedicated them to managing around the social landscape .
It was n't until that point that I recognized that these photographs were actually a large part of the personal loss in these people .
As they fought the tank , they kept it , they left it all , everything was left behind .
At the first week of the week , I went to help a heritage center in the town .
I clean up the thick water , the big bathroom , the big bathroom .
This is also a place where mobile dispensaries have collected pictures .
This is where people talk to them , and I was going to take the honor , because they believed that I could let them clean up the pictures .
It was so moved and excited . I 'd heard that I 'd have to think that out of the face , but only if I 'd actually experienced it .
When I looked through the pictures , there was some more than a hundred years old , some still in the envelope from the orthopedic boots . I thought , that s a photo-modified person I could wound and that , and I knew , hundreds of other people could do that .
So I went to Facebook at night and I asked a couple of people , and in the morning , I got a lot of positive feedback , and I knew I had to start my job .
We started to fix these pictures .
This is the first one .
It does n't hurt very much , but it makes it water-changing , it has to be repaired with precision and very high crystallized .
If not , the girl in the picture does n't look like her anymore , and it certainly does n't look as bad as having a broken photograph .
Over the time , very lucky , many images were coming back , and they needed some edges , and so again , I went on Facebook and LinkedIn , and in the next year , I found 80 people who wanted to help from 12 different countries .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people who wanted to join .
In Japan , up to AK , we 've expanded Rikenzenakenata , far north to the north of the Yamaican town .
Once a week , we installed our scanner in the temporary library that had set up , so that people would get to regain their pictures .
Older women sometimes have n't seen a scanner , but after 10 minutes , finding her loss , gave us a scanner to scan , upload a server , to download it down by a gajin , a stranger , somewhere in the world , and started to fix it .
Time for restoration is a completely different story , and obviously depends on the damaging level of the image .
It can take an hour . It can take a week .
It can take months .
The monmonmonolithic in this photograph is almost the same as the hand , or the panels , from the colors and the rest are not damaged .
It takes a long time .
Now , all of these images had broken water , steeped in salt , covered in salt water , covered with bacteria , wasted in waste , sometimes in oil , all the time , so they would continue to fail . So clean them up is a big part of the project .
We could n't fix if the images were n't clean , dry and dry .
We were lucky to widen your hands .
There was a great local woman who took us .
Very damaging for these images .
My team of Wynne once said , It s like tattoos for someone .
You do n't have a chance to make a mistake .
The woman gave us these photographs in luck , when they could get there .
She had self-cleaning them and stopped recognizing that she was doing something much more damaging .
She also had a copy of the picture .
If not , the places like her husband and her face are never going to be recovered , just put them together in a different image , and remake the whole picture .
When you take pictures from us , she shared a little bit of her story .
These pictures have been found from her husband s husband in a firefight , in the middle of the long distances , from where the house is destroyed , and they 've found him .
Day tsunami , he s responsible for closing the tsunami .
He had to go into the flow of water when the press rippled .
Two little boys , little kids , now , two boys , are all in school , two different schools .
A child stuck in a water stream .
A week , she just found out that they all survived .
The day I returned to her was also her son s son , and she was 14 years old .
For her , after all , these photographs were the perfect gift to him , something it could look again , to remember the past that had n't been danced since the March of Thursday , when the whole life had been confused or damaged .
After six months in Japan , 1 , 100 volunteers joined the Hands of Hands , in which hundreds of people had escalated over 135 , 000 , most — — — most of the images had come back to their boss , and this was a really important thing .
Over the next hundred years , global volunteers have helped more than 90 families , hundreds of photos have been completely recovered and corrected .
In this time , we have n't spent a thousand dollars on the equipment and materials , most of the cost is for the printer .
We photographed continuously .
Every picture reminded someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
These are the record holders and our stories , and that s the last thing we can cite and the first thing that we can go back to .
That s the point of this whole project , restoring small pieces of human beings , bringing back to somebody .
When a picture like this was brought back , it would create a huge variable in the lives of the receiver .
It also makes a huge difference in people s lives .
For some people , they were connected to something big , giving away something , use their gifts to something other than the skeleton and the leather lanes .
I wanted to read an email to finish this talk . Email from Cindy , who helped fix it , sent me a day to return from Japan after six months .
When I work , I ca n't think of every single person and the stories that hold in the photographs .
There was a photograph , a lot of the women in the house , from the old to the child , sitting around a little girl , beating me because my house also had a similar photo , my mother , my mother , my mother , me , and my daughter , hang on the wall .
On the other hand , no matter what time , our basic needs are like , right ?
Thank you .
I was around 50 meters below a legal mine in Ghana .
The air is vacuum and it s also hot , and it s very difficult to breathe .
I can feel the collision from the shadows of sweat through the dark , but I ca n't feel better .
I hear the voice , but it s almost like the whole catchment of couples and stones that are smashed up with very primitive tools .
As people , I 'm wearing a low-cost cell lamp on their head , and it s attached to the old rubber rings , and I 'm barely able to look at the shadows of a 0 . 28 hundred feet deep down to the ground .
When I fell in my hands , I was reminded of a mine who had just met a few days before he had fallen in .
When I talk to you today , these people are still in the deep hole , risk of living without a salary , and often die .
I was climbed out of that hole , and I was going home , but they would never get home , because they got into the slave .
In the last 28 years , I 've collected local cultural documents in over 70 continents , and in 2009 , I 've had the privilege to become the only exhibit at the Vancouver Convention on Vancouver .
Of the amazing people I met there , I met a man who supported the Academy of Empire , a member of the NGO who wiped at the end of modern slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and actually I started looking at slavery because I knew it existed in the world , but not so much .
After the talk , I was so terrified and really embarrassed by this brutality of the brutality of my life , and I thought , well , if I do n't know , how many people would n't know ?
It started a mind , so a couple of weeks later , I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the Natural Department and asked them .
And so the journey began the process of getting into the modern world .
The strangeness was before that I 'd gone to a lot of these places .
Some places I considered my house .
But this time , I 'd like to see the truth being covered .
A wide-ranking estimate tells us that more than 27 million people are being slaved into slavery in the world today .
Sometimes people were taken from Africa during the era of trade across the Atlantic Ocean .
150 years ago , a slave had three times the cost of an American worker .
That s about 50 , 000 U . S . dollars today .
But today , many generations of families are enslaved through many generations only with 18 dollars .
Seriously , slave slave is worth more than 13 billion dollars a year in the world .
A lot of people are fooled by great education , better work , just to see if you 're arrested without violence , and not escaping .
Today it s service for trade , goods that slaves have value , but people who create them are considered waste .
There s almost a near-life slavery anywhere in the world , no matter where it is .
In India and Nepal , I was taken to a brick oven .
This strange landscape looks like going into the ancient world or the Shute of Dante .
The surrounding temperature of more than 54 degrees , men , women , all families , were covered in blindfolded dust , made up of machines , all the way up to 18 inks at each time , and they carried it from burrot ots to trucks who were there so hundreds of meters .
Wait by the overlap and the exposure , they silence , and over and over again , 16 or 17 hours a day .
Without food , hours of dieting , because seriously the loss of water should seem trivial .
The slash and dust spread all over the place that my camera is so hot that it ca n't touch the record .
Every 20 minutes , I have to go back to the wildlife to get the device and let them work under the thermostat , and when I sit there , I think , my camera gets better than any other person .
Back in the brick , I just wanted to cry , but the owner of the mangrove next to me quickly grabs me and says , Lisa , do n't do that . Do n't do that .
He explained that emotions are dangerous in places like this , not for me , but for them .
I could n't help them .
I could n't give them any money .
I 'm not a citizen .
I can get them into the situation much worse than their current situation .
I have to rely on the Freedom of Empire to work in the system to release them , and I believe they can .
For me , wait till home to really feel pain .
In the Himalayas , I saw children rode across several miles of mountains down on the downside .
The bigger sheets , the kids , the kids , the kids , they pick them up , using the frame from wood , the rope , the fabric and the argassum .
Standard of such incredible things .
How can we create this damn thing , and that s what happened in the first place ?
Some people do n't even know they 're wired up , they do n't work 16 , 17 hours a day , because they only know that .
They have nothing to compare .
When the villagers demanded freedom , their wives would clean up their homes .
These people do n't have anything , they die , they want to go ahead , but the woman in the middle of the quiet and call them to persuade people to persuade , and the serpent owners at the moment to help them get their own copper , so they still do their own work , but they work for them , and they 're paid themselves , and they do it in the freedom .
We tend to think about sexual slavery when we hear from slave , and because of this general sense , I 'm told it s going to be very difficult to work safely in this particular industry .
In Kathmandu , I was supported by women who had been sexual slavery .
They took me down to the mid-level hierarchies down in the middle of the tunnel , in the dimming of the light .
This is not a territory .
It s more like a restaurant .
Likewise restaurants , known as being in the industry , are places of rape sex .
Every place where there s a small room , where slaves , women , little boys and girls , are being seized for their customers , for example , they buy more alcohol and food .
The bedroom is nasty and dark , and it s recognized by the number of paint on the wall by the jungle and the curtain .
The folks who are doing this have a huge sexual abuse under their hands .
In that nearby corner , I remember feeling booming up , and that moment , I understood what was in the hell .
There s one way to go : the staircase that I went in .
There s no backdoor .
There s no big window .
These people have no escaping , when we talk about that difficult topic , we need to remember that slave , including slave , which includes sex , which is where we live .
There are tens of thousands of people who are caught in slavery in agriculture , in restaurants , with ironically abortion in their homes , and the list is long .
Recently , the New York Times reported from 100 , 000 to 300 , 000 children in America were sold to sex slavery every year .
It s all around us . We just do n't see it .
The textiles industry are often thought when they hear about slavery workers .
I 've been to many villages in India , where a lot of families have been slaved in the silk salad .
This is the family portrait .
The handkerchiefs are the father , the green and the red are his sons .
They mixed the stadium in these big barrels , and they dipped it up to the bottom of their hands , although the dye is very poisonous .
My translator tells them their story .
They said , We do n't have freedom .
But still hope that someday can leave this house and go somewhere else where we get paid by the fabric .
It is estimated that more than 4 , 000 children are doing slave at Volta , the largest lake in the world .
When I first got there , I went to a look at it .
I see a lot like a family fishing in the boat , two boys , some younger boys , some younger boys , seems logical ?
False . They 're all slavery .
Kids were taken out of their families , sales and missing , and they were arrested on the sails in these waters , but they did n't know how to swim .
This eight-year-old child .
She shaking when our boats up near the edge , just feared over her little canoe .
He was terrified of falling into the water .
The trees accumulate into the Volta Claus , often into the fisheries of the fish , and the kids just got terrified and pushed their tongue down the water to get the tongue .
A lot of them drown .
What he remembered was he was arrested at the lake .
Too afraid of the owner , I do n't want to escape , and because of the disabled , I continue that down to the smaller slaves that I manage .
I met these little boys at 5 in the morning , when they were pulling in the last net , but they worked from an hour .
And it s cold in the night sky .
We need to note that these nets are approximately 5 , 000-odd when they 're full of fish .
I 'd like to introduce you to Kofi .
Kofi was saved from a village .
I met the boy in the aid community where the Aboriginal Index liberates the restorative victims .
This is where I 'm baking in a bathtub , and it s great news that , when you and I 'm sitting today , Kofi was reunited with my family , and better than that , the family was given a tool to make a living and keep the children safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
What would you be if someone stood up and changed my life ?
Drive on the road in Ghana , but also the colleagues in the liberal Academy , one of you who is a slave , who motorbikes the electric fields up by us and knocking on the door .
He told us to go along the road in the jungle .
At the end of the road , he gives us a break , and he pays the car right away .
And then just into this sublime footprint and says , Here s the way , here s the way . Go away .
In that way , we map the entrance to the entrance , and after about an hour of walking in the forest , the trace had fallen in the water after the rainy store , so I took my picture to the deep water .
After two hours of crackers , the trace around to end in empty space , and in front of our eyes is a huge area of black holes in the football , they 're full of slavery workers .
A lot of women have their back on their back when the gold of the gold water , and they come through a poorly infected water .
The bank was used during the extracting process .
These miners were slavery in the mines of the mine in another part of Ghana .
When they come out of the tunnel , they get wet by their own sweat .
I remember looking at red eyes , and they were tired of people who had been underground to 72 hours .
And the tunnels come down to a hundred meters , and they go on a heavy stack to get them to the other area , where the rock is bound to fall out for the gold .
Look , the public sector does n't look very strong people , but when you look back , there s a lot less lucky than working in extreme situations , there s children .
They are victims of vulnerability , disease and violence .
In fact , many of these muscles will end up like this person , who has broken down and infection in a few years .
This is Manuru . As he died , he got his attention to the park .
When the uncle died , Manuru next to his debt , was forced to slap in this mine .
When I met , he worked 14 years in the mines , and the wound on the leg , and this is from an accident , a very heavy leg , that physician said he had to quit .
On top of that , Manuru has T . B . , but it still gets arrested day in the day of the mine .
And yet , he still dreams the freedom of liberation with the help of local activists like the Association of Empire , and determined like this , on the face of strangers , making me overwhelmingly overwhelmed .
I want to slave the light .
When I was working in this area , I brought along a lot of candles , with the help of translating people , I transferred to the people that I wanted to light my stories and their circumstances , and when they were safe I was safe I took these images .
They know their image is going to be seen by the people out there , like you .
I want them to know that we 're going to prove them , and we 're going to do anything that can help them change their lives .
I truly believe , if you look at other people as peoples , it s really hard to drill down such crimes as slavery .
The pictures are not about themselves . They 're about real people , as you and me , all deserve equal rights , honor and respectful .
No day I do n't think about these amazing people , I have a big honor to meet them .
I hope those pictures will awaken a source of power in the viewer , people like you , and that power will fire , that fire will glow in the slang , because there are no lights , the monsters of the prison will continue to live in the dark .
Thank you very much .
