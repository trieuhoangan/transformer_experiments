When I was a kid , I thought the Korean vaccine was the best country in the world , and I used to sing , We have nothing to be a refugee .
I was very proud of my country .
In school , we spent a lot of time learning about the lives of the Kim I-Sung president , but we did n't learn much about the outside world , except for the United States , Korea and Japan were our enemies .
Whatever I 've ever wondered how the world is out there , but I still think I 'm going to live my whole life in Korea , until everything suddenly has changed .
When I was seven , I witnessed the scene where people were doing the first time in their life , but I still thought that my life was totally fine .
My family was not poor , and I was never hungry .
But one day of 1995 , my mother brought home a letter from a sister who was working with her mother .
In that says , When you read these lines , your whole family had no longer been on the ground , because your whole family had nothing to eat for two weeks .
It was all on the floor , and our bodies were so weak that they could feel like death was coming very close .
I was shocked .
Because it was the first time that I knew that my people were suffering like that .
Shortly after that , as I walked through a gas station , I saw an awful scene that I could never forget .
On the gas floor is the death of a woman with two hands holding a baby , and the child just stares at her mother s face .
But no one s helping them , because all of them are having to worry about themselves and the whole family .
In the mid-90s , North Korea went through a severe famine .
It makes more than a million Indians die in poverty , and many of them survive only to eat grass , beetles and shells and shells .
The electricity became more and more and more frequent , so everything around me went to the dark when the night came except for the light from the Chinese side just how my home was a river .
I always wondered why they had electricity and we did n't .
This is a picture from the North Korea satellite at night corresponding to the countries around the world .
This is the Austrian River , which is a natural border between North Korea and China .
You can see that the river was very narrow , so some of the people in North Korea were very secret to China .
But a lot of people died .
And I saw exactly the people floating on the river .
I could n't speak specifically about how much I had fled from North Korea , just to say that in the hard years , that hunger I was sent to China to live with a farmer .
At that point , I just thought I would have to go far from home .
I never could have imagined that I would have been 14 years away from them .
In China , the life of a girl is separated from my family as hard as I am .
I was n't able to see what happened to the lives of a refugee from North Korea , but I soon realized not only that it was very difficult , but it was very dangerous , because the refugees from North Korea into China were considered to be the illegal immigrants .
I always live in a regular fear that my identity will be detected , and I will be returned to the old life in North Korea .
One day , that night , that nightmare became the truth , and I was taken by the police officer and taken to the police to question the question .
Somebody reported to them that I was North Korea , so they tested my Mandarin and asked me a lot of questions .
I was terrified , and it felt like my heart was about to explode .
Because if they see something that s not natural , I 'm going to get in prison and get paid back to the water .
I think my life is over , but I 'm still trying to drive my emotions and answer their questions .
After the end of it , one of the two cops said to the other , This is a false point .
It s not North Korean .
And they dropped me off . It was a miracle .
Some of the North Koreans in China went to foreign ambassadors to envy refugee refugees , but many of them were arrested by the Chinese police and was paid back to the country .
These girls were very lucky .
Because even though it s been arrested , it s finally been released by the force from the international community .
But the North Koreans are not that lucky .
Every year , there are so many North Koreans being caught in China and being paid back to the country , where they are tortured , imprisoned or incarcerated .
And while I was very lucky to have been released , many of my people did n't .
The North Koreans had to cover their identity and struggle to survive as a tragedy .
Even if they had learned Chinese and found a job , their life would have been completely isolated for a moment .
That s why after 10 years of mapping the real identity I decided to lose myself to South Korea , to start a new life again .
It s much harder to stabilize life here than I would have imagined .
Because in South Korea , English has a very important position , so I started to learn English , my third language .
I also realized a huge gap between South and North Korea .
We 're all Koreans , but we 've become very different because of the consequences of 67 years being divided .
I had a crisis of my origins .
I 'm an Korean or North Korea ?
Where do I come from ? And who am I ?
Suddenly , I did n't have a country to be proud of called the National Organization .
Despite adapting to life in South Korea , it s not that easy , but I set up a plan .
And I started to learn to prepare for college exams .
However , as soon as I 've just gotten used to life here , I 've got a terrible news .
The North Korean government found out how much money I sent back to my family , and , in order to punish , they would start my family to move to a district in the countryside .
So they could quickly get out of it , and I started a plan to get my family out of it .
North Koreans had to cross unthinkable gaps to freedom .
Because getting across the border from North to South Korea is almost impossible , so I had to fly to China and go back to the border of North Korea .
Because my family did n't know the Chinese language , I had to go with people over 2 , 000 miles across China and go to East Asia .
The bus journey was about a week , and we were almost caught .
Once , our car was stopped and retreated by a Chinese police officer .
He proved to prove everybody else s letter , and he started to ask questions .
Because my family did n't understand the Chinese language , so I thought they would be arrested .
When the Chinese police came to them , I immediately got up and said to him , These are the deaf men that I have to go with .
He looked at me suspicious , but fortunately he believed me .
And we kept on going to the Nice border , and I had to spend nearly all the money I had to bribe to pay for the Lesters of the border .
However , after we cross borders , my family was arrested in prison for cross-border crime .
And after I applied the fine money and bribed the bribe , my family was released for a month , and it was arrested again in the capital of Lang .
It was the most hopeful moment in my life .
I 've done all kinds of ways to bring my family to freedom , and we 're almost done , but they 're arrested while we 're only Korean ambassador very short .
I went back to the middle of the police and the police station , hoping to find a way to get my family out of there , but I could n't afford to bribe or pay for any money .
I was desperate .
At the time , there was a man who asked me , What s going on ?
I was so surprised when someone was totally strangely alien was interested in asking me so much .
In my very little English language and a dictionary , I told him the context of my family . Not a single reason , that man went to ATM machine , paid all the money for both my family and two North Koreans to get out of jail .
I was thanking him with all my heart , and I also asked him , Why did you help me ?
I did n't help her , he said .
' I 'm helping North Koreans .
I realized it was a very important moment in my life .
The good from the strangeness man became a new symbol of hope for me and the North Koreans that we were looking for , and he showed me the kindness of the strangeness and the support of the international community was the kind of hopes that the North Koreans were looking for .
Finally , after a long journey and family had been reunited in Korea , but to come with freedom is only half of the struggle .
Many North Koreans are being divided with their families , and when they get to another country , they have to start at the beginning with very few or very little money .
So we can get help from the international community for education , for education , for teaching English , for teaching , for many other areas .
We can also play as a bridge between people in North Korea with the outside world , because there are many of us who are keeping contact with other family members in the country , and we share the information and money to change North Korea from the inside .
I was very lucky to get a lot of help and inspirational for my life , so I wanted to share the power to bring my country a chance of developing with the international support .
I believe you 're going to see more and more North Koreans succeeding in the world , even on the TED stage .
Thank you .
Today I have only one requirement .
Do n't tell me that I 'm normal .
Now I want to introduce you to my brother .
Remi is 22 years old , high and very handsome .
I could n't speak , but I transferred joy in the way that even some of the best heroes could n't do it .
Remi knows what love is .
I share it unconditionally , however .
He s not greedy . I 'm not colored .
I do n't care about the religious differences , and let s understand this : I 've never lying .
When I sing songs from our childhood , trying to remember words that came to me could n't , she reminds me one thing : how little we know about the brain , and what we do n't know how great it is .
Samuel was 16 years old . He was high . He was also very handsome .
You have a perfect memory .
But there s also selection .
I do n't remember if I could whistle my chocolate belt , but I remember the first year of my iPod , the conversations between us from my four-year-old brother Teletubbies on my first day , and Lady Gaga s birthday .
It sounds great , right ?
But most people do n't agree .
And the fact is that , because our minds are not suited for the average social version , they 're often overlooked and misunderstood .
But what makes my heart reliable and my soul more powerful is that , although this is true , even though they 're not supposed to be normal , it can only mean that they 're extraordinary -- the autistic and the extraordinary people .
For you , it s not very familiar with the phrase ' it s a brain disorder that affects the ability to communicate social , learn and sometimes physically .
The disease epidemic in each individual , which is why Remi is very different from Sam .
And all over the world , every 20 minutes there s another person diagnosed with autism , and even though it s one of the fastest growing disorder in the world , we do n't know the cause or treatment .
And I could n't remember the first time I had access to autism , but I could n't remember one day without it .
I was three years old when my brother was born and I was so excited that there was another person in my life .
And after a few months , I realized that I was different .
I 'm screaming so much .
I do n't want to play as many other kids , and in fact , I do n't seem to enjoy me or anything else .
Remi lives and takes care of his own world , with his own rules , and I find it in the smallest thing , like putting a car around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything in the hand .
As I was growing up , I became more different , and the difference became clearer .
But beyond the humiliation and the excitement of motivation is something that is so unique : a pure and naive instinct , a boy who looks at his life without prejudice , a person who never lies .
Africa is often .
Well , I could n't deny that there was some tough moments in my family , the moments that I wanted them to be like me .
But I took my memory back to what they had taught me about personality , communication and love , and I realized that these are things that I would n't change to get normal .
Ordinary miss the beauty that distinguishes us and that we 're different from each other does n't mean that one of us has something wrong .
It means there s only one other type of thing ' it s the right thing .
And if I can only convey one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you , that s that you do n't have to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because there s autism , the difference between us -- we have a gift ! Everybody carries us a gift , and in fact , pursuing the ordinary is the greatest sacrifice .
The opportunities for magnitude , progress and change are shut down when we try to become like another person .
Please -- do n't say I 'm normal .
Thank you .
You probably all agree with me , this is a very nice way to do it .
It s built out of sugar , and the asphalt is a material that runs on it , but not always , especially not in these days when it rains a lot .
And then you can get water on the way to the tank .
And especially if you ride a bike , and you cross these cars , it s not good .
And also , the plastics are much more noise .
It s a noisy material , if we make the streets of the Netherlands , very close to cities , we want a quiet road .
The solution to the problem is to make pathways from porous plastics .
The sugars are the materials that we 're using now to build almost any of the countries in the Netherlands , and it s got holes and water just flowing through the hole , so all the rainwater is going to escape from all sides , and you 're going to have a road to drive . So there s no more water .
And noise disappeared through the ovaries .
Because it s very empty , all the noise will be gone , so the street is very quiet .
Of course , there s still so much uncomfortable , and the inconvenience of this street is that the butter , the bubble can happen .
What s the cracks ? You see that in this street , the mask is buried by the face .
First you get a rock , then more , more , more , more , more , more , and then they -- oh , I wo n't do that .
But they can damage your car window . So you 're not happy with that .
And then , in the end , the cracked state will fail more and more .
Sometimes they make chicken nuts .
Oh . He s ready .
So chicken , of course , can be a problem , but we have a solution .
Actually , what you see here is how damaged this material is .
It s porous plastic , as I said , you only have a small amount of glue stuck between the stones .
Under the impact of the weather , the sun radiation , this plastic moisture , this plastic bitum , the synapses that are sticky between these blocks , and if you contract , it s going to have very small cracks , and then it s going to be coming out of the blocks .
And if you drive on that road , you destroy these blocks -- as we just saw here .
To address this , we 've created self-assembly materials .
If we created this self-assembly material , then we could find a solution .
What we can do is use the steel butter to wash the bush , and we cut the piece of steel , which is actually small , and we mix these little bits with bitum plastic .
So we have sugar that s mixed with very small steel debris .
Then you need a machine , as you can see here , which is a machine that can cook -- a magnetic sensor .
The sensors of words can make heat , especially steel can make it very good .
What you do is you heat up steel , you blew up the bitum , and plastic bitum is going to flow into these micro-cracks , and the stone is going to stick to the surface .
I 'm using a microwave today , because I ca n't bring the sensor from the squatter to the stage .
The microwave wave also has the same system .
I put the prototype in the oven , I 'm now going to take it out . Let s see how it s going .
This is the prototype that came out of it .
I said we invented an industrial machine like this in the lab to heat the samples up .
At the lab we tried many patterns , and then the government , they actually saw the results , and they said , Oh , that s great . We have to try this .
Then they interacted with us on a freeway , 400 meters across the A58 , where we had to build this new material test .
So that s what we 've done here . You look at the way we did , and of course this path will last for many years without being harmed . That s what we learned from the experimentation .
We took a lot of samples from this street and we tried them in the lab .
So we aging the sample , we put a lot of load on it , put it together with a word sensor , put it together and then we try it again .
We can do it over and over again .
And in fact , the conclusion that came out of this study was that if we asked the road four times a year with a machine -- this is a big version of the size that we built to protect the real -- if every four years we were telling the pathway to do twice the length of the street , of course , it would save twice the amount of money .
Well , to wrap it up , I can tell you that we 've created a material that uses steel strings , adding steel strings , using electromagnetic heat , to actually increase the amount of longevity of the road , which is what you can do , even though you can do , twice the amount of life expectancy by very simple tricks . It will save a lot of money .
Now you 're probably wondering if it s going to work .
We also have the prototype here . It s pretty warm .
It was supposed to let it cool down first , and I just showed you the effectiveness of the compound .
But let me try that .
Look at that . Yes , it s sticky .
Thank you .
I 'm here today to talk about a confused question that the answer is not as confusing as it is .
The theme is the secret to family violence , and the question I ask is the question people always ask : Why is she staying ?
Why should women stay with the person who beat them ?
I 'm not a psychiatrist , I 'm not a social worker or a family violence expert .
I was just a woman who wanted to share her story .
I was 22 years old , and I graduated from Harvard University .
I moved to New York City when I was doing my first job writing and editor for The Seventeen magazine .
For the first time I had my own apartment , my own American Express credit card , and I had a big secret .
The secret is , this gun was held up with a hollow patch on my head because the man I thought was a partner , over and over again .
The man I loved more than all the men who shot in their heads and threatened to kill me how many times I could n't remember .
I 'm here to tell you about this crazy love , a psychological trap that millions of women have every year .
This could be your story .
I do n't look like a family violence consultant .
I had an English voyeurism from Harvard University , and the head of marketing from Wharton business .
I 've been so many of my career working for companies in the top 500 of America like Johnson and Johnson , Leo Burnett and the Washington Times .
I married with my second husband for almost 20 years and got together with three children .
My dog was like Black Lab , and I drove the Honda Odyssey .
So the first thing I want to tell you is that domestic violence happens to everybody else , every religion , every level of income and education .
It happens everywhere .
And the second thing I want to say is that people think that domestic violence happens to women , which is the problem of women .
It s not true .
More than 85 percent of the perpetrators are men , and domestic violence happens only in the very intimate , very long , long , in other words , in the family , where we want or expect to see that violence is a reason for domestic violence .
I said to myself , I 'm the other person on Earth who lives with the man who beat me , but in fact , I 'm a typical victim of my age .
I was only 22 years old , living in the U . S . , women between 16 and 24 times more likely to be a victim of domestic violence than women in other ages , and over 500 women and girls in this age are killed every year by the perpetrators , the brothers , and the husband in the U . S .
I was also a typical victim , because I did n't know anything about domestic violence , the warning signals or patterns of it .
I met Conor one night in January , rain and cold .
He sat next to me in the tunnel of New york , and he started talking to me .
He told me about two things .
One was that he , like me , graduated from Ivy League and that he worked in a very impressive bank in Wall Street .
But the thing that was most striking to me in the first meeting was that he was smart , and he looked like a farmer .
He had this big pair of apples , the big apple cheeks and hairstyles like the yellow field , and he seemed sweet .
One of the smartest things Conor did , since the beginning , was to create a illusion that I was a promising partner .
He did this segregated at the beginning by respectling me .
We started dating , and he loved me on every aspect that I was smart , that I picked Harvard , that I loved helping girls grow up and work .
He wanted to know everything about my family and about my childhood , my hopes and dreams .
Conor believed me , as a writer and a woman in a way that no one has ever had before .
And he also created this incredible atmosphere of trust between us by admitting his secrets , that he was as a child from the age of four who had been abused to rebuild his dignity and continuously by his staggering father , and the contrary went off at eight , even though he was very smart and he took almost 20 years to rebuild his life .
That explains why the degrees of Ivy Leage and his work in Wall Street and his bright future matter to him .
If you tell me that this smart , funny man , sensitive man , loved me every day , who loved me whenever I got my page , how short my skirts were , where I lived , who I was , who I was in my friend and where I was in Christmas , I would laugh at you because there was no luck of violence or control or anger at the beginning of Conor at the Conor .
I did n't know that the first phase of any domestic violence is temptation and charisma .
I also did n't know that the second stage was to have victims .
Now , Conor did n't come home one day and say , Hey , you know , all these Romeo and juliet are great , but I need to move on to the next stage where I isolated and did — so I need to take you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear her scream and get out of this city where my friends and colleagues can see their purposes .
Instead , Conor went home on a Friday night and he said to me that he took his dream today , and he said , Well , he left his job , because I made him feel safe in Wall Street , and he just wanted to walk out of the city of Wall Street , and he just wanted to go to a little town in New England where he could start with his life .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York and my dream , but I thought you had to sacrifice my partner , so I agreed , Conor and I left Manhattan .
I did n't think that I had entered a crazy love , that I was entering the first steps into a psychological trap , money and accuracy that had been put very carefully .
The next step in this scenario of violence is to put into the threats of violence and see how she responds .
From here , the guns come in .
When we moved to New England -- you know , where Conor was based to be safe -- he bought three guns .
He holds a tree in the van of our car .
A tree under our bedroom , the third tree , he s always in the middle of the wallet .
And he said that he needed these guns because of the damage he had experienced in the past as a child .
He needed them to feel protected .
But these guns are actually a message for me , and even though he has n't given his hand to me , my life is in danger every minute .
Conor attacked me five days before our wedding .
It was seven o'clock in the morning when I was wearing my bedroom .
I was wiping my feet on the roof , trying to fade into my comments , and I was frustrated , Conor used my anger as a defect to take my hands around my neck and get so tight that I could n't breathe or scream , and he was using my head to the wall with me constantly .
Five days later , 10 bruises on my neck were coming up , and I wore my mother s wedding dress , and I was married with him .
Even though what happened , I 'm still sure we 'll live happily because I love him and he loves me a lot .
And he was so sorry .
He was really stressed out because of his wedding and his family .
It was an individual endeavor , and he would never hurt me again .
It happened twice in the honeymoon .
For the first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I was lost , and he hit on one side of my head very , very strongly pushing my head to the window of the car .
A few days later , when he was driving home after the moon , he was tired of the car , and he threw out all the Big Mac food bag in my face .
Conor then hit me once every two weeks for the next two months and a half years from the time of marriage .
I was wrong to think that I was the only case and I was alone in this .
One third of American women experienced domestic violence or were blocked in some of the stages of their life and reported that 15 million children were abused every year , 15 million .
So I was actually in a really good company .
So back to my question : Why am I still ?
The answer is very easy .
I do n't know he s in the violence of me .
Even he put a gun in my head , threw me down on the floor , threatened to kill my dogs , pulled the keys out of the car while I was driving the highway , grinds grincafe on my head when I was wearing the board for the interview , I never once thought of myself as a wife being executed .
Instead , I was a strong woman in love with a man with a problem , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor confront his evil .
The other question people often ask is , why did n't she leave ?
Why did n't I walk ? I could leave any time .
For me , it was the most painful and painful question , because we , the victims know something you do n't often know about : it s a terrible danger to leave one of the persons like that .
Because the last step in the family s drama was to kill her .
More than 70 percent of the domestic violence that happened after the victim has finished the relationship , after she left , because then the assault had nothing to lose .
But as a result of that long surveillance , even after the recruitment of the recruitment of the financial resources ' and the movement of her family to scare the victims and her children , these children are often constrained by the decisions of the juxtaposition of the court time with the man who beat their mother .
And we kept asking , why do n't she leave ?
I was able to move away , because a cruel of violence finally broke my giving up .
I realized that the man I loved would kill me if I left him .
So I broke my silence .
I told people : the police , the neighbors , my friends and family , who are totally exotic , and I 'm here today because you 're all helping me .
We have the stereotypes of victims as frightening headlines , women who destroy themselves , good things that are damaged .
The question , Why is she staying ?
That s the reason some people , that s her fault when they stay as if the victim has chosen to love men with the intention of destroying us .
But since the publishing Crazy Love , I 've heard hundreds of stories from men and women who have left , who have learned an infinite life lesson but what has happened , and who have rebuilt their lives -- happy , funny -- like the employees , the mothers , the lives , the lives that are totally unviolent , as I do .
Because in fact , I was a typical victim of domestic violence that ended me as a foreigner of family violence .
I married with a very nice , kindergarten man , and we had three children .
I have a Black Lab and I have a backpack .
What I never had in half was a gun to get in my head because someone said he loved me .
Right now , you might be thinking , Oh , this is great , Oh , she s just been idiot , but all this time , I was really talking about you .
I 'm sure some of you who are listening to me right now are people who are being abused or people who are being abused when you 're a kid or people who are abused to themselves .
Risks can affect your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
I can finish my crazy love story by destroying my silence .
I 'm beating this silence today .
This is how I help other victims , and this is my final requirement .
Let s tell you about what you heard here .
The contrary is only scary in silence .
You have the power to finish your family violence simply by putting a light on it .
We need victims .
We need you to understand the secret to family violence .
Today s light abuse by talking about it with your kids , your colleagues , your friends and your family .
They recover their lives as happy people , loving to the open future .
Knowing early signs of violence and the lies of conscience , reducing it down , showing the victims the way to safe .
Together we can make our bedrooms sit and our families become peaceful and safe islands .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are now 10 , 000 birds in the world .
The chapter is one of the most endangered birds .
When you see a chimpanzee like this , the first thing that comes out of your mind is that , these are really awful , ugly , ugly creatures , dieting and targeting your meat , which relates to politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change the feelings you are giving to these birds , because they need our compassion . They 're really necessary .
Let me tell you why .
First of all , why do they have such a bad impression ?
When Charles Darwin crossed the Pacific in 1832 from the Beagle , he saw Turkish Planetarium , and he said , These birds are really disgusting with the red pole that s created to rejoint in their gut .
You ca n't get worse than that , and those are words from Charles Darwin .
You know , he changed his mind when he came back , let me tell you why .
They 've also been linked to Disne-personalized , messy , idiosyncratic characters .
More recently , if you 're watching the news in Kenya -- these are the characteristics that are associated with the Keya military . But I want to resist that .
I want to fight back because you know what ?
Because the police do n't keep the environment clean .
The scenario does n't help prevent the spread of disease .
They could hardly have a regime of a husband .
They have only been extinct .
And , what I like the most is , the chips look a lot more .
There are two kinds of meditators on the planet .
The World Trade Organization found mainly in the U . S . , like the conjunction and cardor and caracaras , then the World Bank , where there are about 16 species . Of these 16 species , there are 11 species that face high risk of extinction .
So , why is it important ? First of all , they provide essential ecological services . They clean up .
They 're really natural garbage gatherers .
They cleaned up the dead bodies up to the bones .
They kill the bacteria . They help absorb the coal that could spread and cause enormous loss to the livestock industry and disease for other animals .
The most recent studies that have shown in areas where there is no dead scheme that takes about three to four times more time to biodegrade , and the big outcome from this is the spread of disease .
Money also has a great history of their importance .
They 've been connected to ancient Egyptian culture .
Nekhbet is the symbol of the protector and the mother , and together with the snake , they symbolize the integrity of the Egyptian Embassy .
In Hindu mythology , Jatayu is the chief god , and he risk his life to save the Sita woman from the top 10 head of Ravana .
In Tibet culture , they do it very important . In places like Tibet , there s no place to bury people , or there s no wood to bite them , so the chips provide a natural waste system .
So what s the scheme going on ?
We have eight species of almond species in Kenya , of which six species are endangered with high risk of extinction .
The reason is that they 're being poisoned , they 're poisoned because there s competition between people and the wild world , and the colonies that are using this toxic poison to get into predatory animals , but instead , the chimpanzees are for this kind of victims .
In South Asia , countries like India and Pakistan , four of them are enrolled in a list of highly dangerous ones , which means they 're only less than 10 or 15 years less to touch extinction , and that s because they 're being turned into a livestock prey because the livestock has been treated with a drug reduction like Diclofenac .
This was banned for medical interest in India . They proved that .
Because there s no meditation , so there s a huge amount of dogs in these areas of animal waste , when you have a wild dog , you have a huge time bomb of paranoia . The cases of paranoia have gone up a lot in India .
Kenya will have the largest windmill in Africa with 353 engines built in Lake Turkana .
I 'm not against the wind , but we need to work with the government , because the wind engine makes the birds look like this . They cut them down .
They 're the birds .
In West Africa , there s a deadly dead trade industry to serve the stigma market and the turtle .
So what did we do ? We 're working on these birds . We 're putting the signals in them .
We 're trying to figure out their basic ecology , and track where they go .
We can see them moving to a lot of different countries , so if you just pay attention to the issues at the scale of the area , it s not going to help you .
We need to work with government at the regional level .
We 're working with local communities .
We 're talking to them about honoring the intrinsic needs of honoring these fabulous creatures and the benefits that they bring .
How do you help ? You can become a fluent person , create voices . You can write letters to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these misunderstood creatures . Embrace a little bit of time to transmit the message . Loan gives a message .
When you come out of this room , you get the information about the orangutans , but tell your family , your children , your neighbor , your neighbor .
They 're so elegant . Charles Darwin said , He changed his opinion because he saw them fly in the same way that he did n't need a little bit of force in the sky .
Kenya , this world , it would be much , much lower if there were n't these wonderful animals .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 years old , I remember one morning I woke up when I heard the celebration of my house .
My father was listening to the BBC news on his little gray radio .
He expands a big smile , which is unusual because the news often makes him sad .
And he goes , The Taliban is gone !
I did n't understand it , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
Now I can actually go to school , and he said .
One morning I could n't forget .
A real school .
You know , the Taliban came to an invasion of Afghanistan since I was six and forbid girls to go to school .
In the next five years , I was dressed as a boy to come with my sister to a secret school because my sister was forbidden from the house alone .
It was the only way we could go to school .
Every day , we walk differently so that no one has to be suspected of our destination .
We hid books in the market like this , and people will think we 're just going to shopping .
That school in a house , more than 100 children , we put in a small living room .
It s quite warm in winter , but the summer is extremely hot .
We all know that we 're risking our own lives , our teachers , our students and our parents .
Once in a while , the school suddenly shut down about a week because the Taliban were suspicious .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Are we being watched ?
Do you know where we are ?
We were terrified , but nevertheless , we still wanted to go to school .
I was very lucky to be raised in a very respectful family of learning and girls that were honored .
My grandfather was an excellent man at the time .
One person was completely abandoned from a remote waist in Afghanistan , and he was insisted to let my daughter , my mother went to school , and so he had his father quit .
But my mother had an education teacher .
Here she is .
She retired two years ago to use our home as an open school for girls and women in the neighborhood .
And this is my father who was the first person in his family to be educated .
No doubt that his children would be educated , including his daughter , despite the Taliban , and despite the danger .
For him , kids are not taught to be a greater risk .
In the Taliban , I remember that there were times when I was so angry about our lives and that I was always afraid and not going to see the future .
I would love to give up school , but my dad , he would say , Listen , you can lose everything you have in your life .
Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave the house during the war .
But something will forever remain with you , and if we 're forced to sell blood to pay for obesity , we 'll do that .
So what else do you want to continue ?
Today I 'm 22 years old .
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by the past decade of war .
Less than six percent of the older women I had after high school , and if my family did n't commit my education , I too became one of them .
But I 'm standing here as a student from the Middlebury College .
When I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was abandoned by his family because he dared to give his daughter to school , was one of the first to celebrate me .
He was not only my high degree , but also my first woman , and I was the first woman to transport him on the streets of Kabul .
My family believed me .
I dream big , but my family wanted me to be bigger .
So I 'm a global ambassador for 1010 , and this is a global movement to educate women .
So I helped start SOLA , the first school and probably only for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it s still dangerous for girls to go to school .
I was so excited to see the students coming to my school with the expectation to get this opportunity .
And I saw their parents and their fathers as my father , supporting them , regardless and even in the face of a lot of difficulty opposition .
Like Ahmed . That s not his real name , and I could n't tell his face , but Ahmed was my father .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way to SOLA from their village , and they were literally killed by a bomb in just a few minutes .
When he had just come home , the cell phone resume him if he kept taking his daughter to school , they would try it again .
He said , If you want to kill me , but I wo n't destroy my daughter s future for the good and wrong ideas of the people .
I 've now learned about Afghanistan , and this is something that s often overlooked in the West , behind most successful people , is that we are a father to value their girl s value and the person who sees their girl s success as their own success .
This is not to say that mothers are not important in our success .
In fact , they 're the first to be compassionate for a bright future of their daughters , but in a social situation like Afghanistan , we need to be supportive of men .
In the Taliban , girls went to school all the hundreds of people who remembered it was illegal .
But today , more than three million women are in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looked very different from the U . S .
I felt that Americans saw weakness , vulnerability in changes .
I was afraid that all of those changes would not last much longer after the U . S . military pulled out .
But when I went back to Afghanistan , when I saw students in my school and my parents supported them , encouraged them , I saw a promising future and change would live long .
For me , Afghanistan is a country of hope , unlimited ability , and every day the SOLA woman reminds me of that .
Like me , they had a big dream .
Thank you .
Hi . This is my cellphone .
A mobile phone can change your life , and a phone can also give you your personal freedom .
With a mobile phone , you can record human rights hacks in Syria .
With a mobile phone , you can also post a message on Tweeter and start a demonstration against the government in Egypt .
And also with a phone , you can record a song , upload it to SoundCloud and become famous .
All of that can be accessed with your mobile phone .
I was a child of 1984 , and I lived in the city of Berlin .
Let s go back to that moment in the city .
You can see here how thousands of people stand up and express change .
It was in the fall of 1989 , and imagine the people who stood up and the protests required that change had a mobile phone in the bag .
Who in this room has a cell phone ?
Raise it .
Raise your phone , raise your phone !
Raise it up . A Android phone , Blackberry , wow .
Many . Today , most of us have a mobile phone .
But today I 'm going to talk about myself and my phone , and how it changed my life .
I 'm going to talk about that .
There are 35830 blocks of information .
Simple information .
But why is that information here ?
The reason for that is because in the summer of 2006 , the European Committee a core visual indicator .
It s called the data warning .
This shows that every telecommunications company in Europe , every Internet service provider across Europe , has to store a tremendous amount of information about users .
Who s called for somebody ? Who sent someone emails ?
Who sent out mobile messages ?
And if you use your mobile phone , this is where the problem exists .
All this information is stored at least six months , until two years by your network that you 're using or the Internet service provider .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , We do n't want that .
They said , We do n't want this kind of personal archive .
We wanted to get a sense of autonomy in the digital age , and we did n't want that telecomous telecommunications companies and Internet service providers store all of our information .
They 're lawyers , journalists and all indigenous fathers , all say , We do n't want that .
And you can see over here , like 10 , 000 people in the streets of Berlin and the free slope of the freely available slope , unafraid .
And some people even said , it s like Stasi 2 . 0 .
Stasi is the intimate police force in East Germany .
I used to wonder , did it actually work ?
Can they record all of our information ?
Every time we use our mobile phones ?
So I asked the house to use , Deutsche Telekom , who was the greatest German telecommunications provider at that point , and I asked them , Please , give me the whole data that they stored .
I asked them to send me just once , and I went on to ask , but what I got is an unobvious answer . Blah blah blah blah blah .
But then I said , I want to get this information , because they 're storing my life .
And I decided to send the lawsuits to the court , because I wanted to get this information .
But Deutsche Telekom said , no , we 're not going to give you this information .
And finally , I had an agreement with them .
I would destroy the bill , and they would give me the information I needed .
Because at the time , the federal parliament court was regulated that the European Committee was not helpful in the German constitution system .
So I got this ugly brown brown envelope with a CD inside .
And on the CD plate , what I need to be documented on it .
35830 blocks of information .
First I looked at it , and I said , okay . It s a big file . Good data .
But then I realized , this is my entire life .
This is my life in six months , documented all in this data .
And then I wondered a little bit , what should I do with it ?
Because I can see where I went , where I was sleeping every night , what I did .
But then I said , I want to publish this information .
I want it to be known by the public .
Because I want to show you what data stocks really are .
So for Zeit Online and Open Data City , I do the same thing .
These are live images of my life for six months that have been recorded .
You can zoom in or shrink it , you can also turn it backwards or faster forward .
You can see every single step of my life .
You can even tell me how I went to Frankfurt with a train to Cologne , and also the frequency I call the communication between those two places .
It could all be with this information .
I had a little bit of fear .
But that s not just about me .
It s all about us .
First of all , it s just like this , I call my wife and she calls me , we talk to each other a few times .
And then some of my friends call me , they call each other .
A little while later you call you , and you call you , and you get this broad network of communication .
But you can see how we communicate with each other , they call each other , when they go to bed .
You can see it all .
You can see the most important parts , like leaders in a group .
If you have access to this information , you can see the activity of the community , society .
If you have access to this information , you can control the entire society .
This is a drawing of countries like China or Iran .
This is a map of how to look at the entire society because you know who s talking to who s talking to , who s sending emails , all of that would be possible if you could access this information .
And this information was stored for at least six months in Europe , until about two years .
As I said when I started , imagine if all of these guys on the streets of Berlin were in the fall of 1989 , there was a mobile phone in the bag .
And maybe Stasi would know who was involved in this demonstration , and if Stasi knew who was the leader behind it , it would never be possible .
The fall of the Berlin wall may not exist .
And if so , maybe the fall of the iron in the Cold War will not exist .
Because nowadays , functionality agencies and companies want to store information about us as much as we can , both online and online .
They want to be able to track our lives , and so they want to record this information all the time .
Autonomy and living in a digital age is not ambitious .
What you should do is fight your autonomy today .
And you have to fight unstoppable for it every day .
Then , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it s not an outdated thing .
When you go home , tell your representative representatives that by companies and institutions can keep the specific information , even though they do n't necessarily have to .
And if you do n't trust me , ask the network to provide the information they have stored about them .
So in the future , whenever you use your phone to remind you that you have to fight for self-interest in this digital age .
Thank you .
Photography is my passion ever since I was big enough to take a camera , but today I 'd like to share with you 15 of these pictures that I most honor , and I did n't take one of them myself .
There s no artist , there s no model , there s no photograph , there s no light .
In fact , most of them were taken by accidental guerrillas .
The story begins when I went to New York City to participate in a presentation and my wife took a picture I was hugging her daughter on her first birthday . We stood in the corner of the 57 and a half .
We happened to come back to New York a year later , so we decided to take another one .
You can see where the story is going .
When I was on the third birthday of my daughter , my wife said , Why do n't you bring Sabrina to New York to do an expedition with my father and daughter , and then continue the old ritual ?
We 've since then started travel by travel through the street .
You know , the impact of giving a camera to a totally unusual person around the world .
No one s denied , and unfortunately no one s ever given up with our camera .
We did n't know how that journey was going to change our lives .
It became so sacred to us .
This was taken a few weeks after 9 / 11 , and I tried to explain what happened that day in ways that a five-year-old child could understand .
These pictures are not just the object for a moment , or a particular journey .
They 're how we stop the time in a week of October , think about our time and how we change each year , not just physically , but physically .
Because even though we took the same picture , our view changed , my daughter made new marks , and I was able to see her life through her eyes , how she looked and interact with everything .
The time that we 're focused on each other is something that we value and expect all the years .
Recently , in a trip , we were walking , and my daughter suddenly stops the middle of the street , and it s only coming to the red ceiling of the concrete store that she liked when she was a kid in our former trips .
She described it when she was five years old , standing in the right position .
It says it remembered its heart out of the chest when it saw that shop for the first time nine years .
And now what it s seen in New York is the universities , because it decided to go to New York .
And I realized : One of the most important things that we 've created is memory .
So I want to share the idea of an active role in creating memories .
I do n't know about you , but out of these 15 pictures , I do n't show a lot of my family photos .
I 've always been a photographer .
So today I want to encourage you all to be in the picture , and do n't mind stepping into someone else , and asking us , Can you take a picture help us ?
Thank you .
I had never forgotten my grandmother s words -- she died in forgiveness : Hey , let s fight Gaddafi . Let s fight him .
But do n't ever turn into a form of Gaddafi revolution .
For almost two years , since the Darwinian Reformation of Libya exploded , reinforced by the broadcasting waves from the initiatives of Tunisia and Egypt .
I was involved in inner forces and outside Libya to call for the day of prosperity and to start an initiative against the Gaddafi regime .
And that s a great revolution .
The young men of the front line required to toss the government , raise the expressions of freedom , dignity , social justice .
They showed an example of the effectiveness of faced the violent dictatorship of Gaddafi .
They showed an organization of paint that went from east to west and stretched up to the south .
And finally , after six months of great war with total injuries to 50 , 000 people we managed to liberate our country and flip the name of God .
However , Gaddafi left a burden of burden , a legacy of the regime , corruption and split strains .
For the past four decades , Gaddafi s ruins have destroyed infrastructure and culture and the moral foundations of Libya society .
The comprehension of destruction and the challenges , I was like so many other women , and I was in rebuilding Libya s civil society , asking for upheaval and the transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
Almost 200 organizations were built in Benghazi during that time and soon after Gaddafi collapsed -- almost 300 in Tripoli .
After 33 years of forgiveness , I went back to Libya , with a unique enthusiasm , and I started to organize classes that improve the ability , develop people s leadership skills .
In the same group of women , I co-founded Libya for the Civil Rights movement , leaders from all different parts of society , to lobby for social rights for women and for our rights to participate in building democracy and peace .
I was in a very difficult situation at the time of the election , an environment that was getting polarized , an environment formed by a very dominated , systematic political view .
I led an idea by the Women s Enlightenment for Peace to lobby a more inclusive election law , the law that could bring to every citizen , whatever they came from , the right to vote and vote , and most importantly to the rule of political parties that had to abuse male candidates and vertical candidate and vertical candidate and vertical candidate , and in their list they created the keyboard .
At the end of the day , our initiative was also accepted and succeeded .
Women won 17 and a half percent in the Council of Parliament in the first elections in the last 52 years .
However , just a little bit , the excitement from the elections and of the general revolution disappeared -- as every day , we woke up with the news of violence .
We woke up one day with the news of the ancient temples and the hubris of the Sufi .
Another day , we woke up with the news about the American Ambassador and the attack of the conviction .
The other day we get up with the news about the killing of the military officers .
And every day , every day , we wake up with the rules of the military forces and their continuity of human rights and prisoners and unrespected the rules of their laws .
Our societies , created by innovative thinking , became more polarized and removed from ideas , principles of freedom , dignity , social equality that we were following in the beginning .
The unthinkable , the exception and the warning became the symbol of the beginning .
I 'm here without the intention to inspire you with the success story of creating a list of drawings and elections .
And I 'm here to admit that we -- the whole country has made the wrong choice , has made the wrong decision .
We did n't prioritize civil rights .
Because elections do n't bring peace , stability or security to Libya .
Is the draft list and the ddan between male candidates and women who bring peace and reconciliation to the country ?
No , no .
So what would it ultimately do ?
Why do we continue as a polarized and ruled society by the selfish politics of dominance and elimination , by both men and women ?
Perhaps ignorance is not just about women s rights , but about women s values , about compassion , about tolerance , and inclusion .
Our societies need a national conversation and a more constructive community than they need elections that , just increase the polarization and divide .
Our societies need more qualities from women than we need numbers and quantities of female representation .
We need to stop doing things like the wild ambassadors , stop supporting crazy days .
We need to start acting like the ambassadors of compassion and tolerance .
We need to develop a conversation that is not only honored , but it has to actually practice tolerance instead of hatred , collaborating instead of competing , rather than eliminating .
These are the ideas that a country has been devastated like Libya is absolutely necessary to reclaim peace .
Because peace as a hypothesis , it needs to be about reconciliation , about men and women s views .
That s the real key .
And we need to establish the living element before we do our political work .
According to one of the poems in the Koran Salam -- peace -- is from God s full of tolerance , raheem .
Next , from raheem that s known in the traditions of Abraham that share a common origin with the Arabic language is rahem -- facial expressions -- the mother wraps up humanity where men and women , from all tribal tribes , all nationalists , are born .
And because the death is full of embryos growing in its heart , the sacred mama of love feeds all that life .
So we 're taught that our tolerance is filled with things .
So we 're taught that our tolerance wins the tide .
For each of us , we are advocating for tolerance .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I was experiencing a little bit like Alice in Nazi .
The Penn State School asked me , a communication teacher , to teach a course to a engineering student .
I was so scared .
It s really scary . Bring the big students , the big books and the weird words .
But when the open exchange was open , I was experiencing what Alice had been through when she fell down the hillside and discovered that the door led to a new world .
That s just what I felt when I was talking to my students , I was amazed by their ideas , and I wanted others to experience this kind of spiritual experience .
I believe the key to opening the door to the world is the ability to communicate well .
We really need to communicate effectively with scientists and engineers to change the world .
Scientists and engineers are the ones who are facing the biggest challenges , from energy to environment , and so on , if we do n't know and do n't understand that , then it s not finished , and I believe our responsibility , our non-professionals , our interaction with them .
But effective exchange was n't possible if scientists and engineers could n't invite us into their own backyard .
Scientists and engineers , let s be eight of us .
I want to share some of the secret decisions to do that , to make sure that we recognize your science is sexy , technical sexy is also compelling , hot .
The first question is : What ?
Why is science related to us ?
Do n't just tell you that you study bone tissue , let s say you study bone tissue , it s like the networks that make our bones , because we need to know about bone degeneration and treatment .
When you describe science , be careful using the term .
Language stops us understanding your ideas .
It s certainly not possible to say spatial and zero-sum , but why not use space and time .
Make the idea easy to understand is not to lower them .
Instead , as Anh-tone said , making things as simple as possible , but do n't be simpler .
Clearly , you can talk about scientific issues without crossing ideas .
So , as an example , the narrative , the association , these are the ways to engage us and get us interested in what he s talking about .
And when I present , do n't use the front lines .
Have you ever wondered why they were called the beginning of the line ?
What happens when the brick is over ? Little is deleting , killing always ! And they will kill your talk as well .
A slide like this , not only is it boring , but it s so much about the language of the brain , that we 're being dumped .
Instead , this slide of Genefield Brown actually understood the special structure of bone tissue that s so powerful that it s really inspirational for the unique design of the pyramid .
And the trick here is to use simple and understandable sentences to read an audience that can be based on it if they do n't , and then use photos to attract the senses to help us better understand the things that are shown .
I think these are just a few secrets that help us open that door and see the spirit of science and technology .
The engineers I work with have to teach me how to swallow things , so I want to summarize with a equation .
Take science apart from scratch and the term for reliability , which is to share good explanations with the audience , and then to give you the passion he s doing , the result is the perfect interaction .
And so , as scientists and engineers , when you solve this equation , at all expenses , let s say eight things to me .
Thank you .
Hi . I 'm Cameron Russell , and in the last short run , I 'm a model .
In fact , in 10 years .
And I felt that there was an uncomfortable pressure in the room at this point because I should n't wear this bruise .
Luckily I brought another piece of furniture .
This was the first time someone was working on the TED stage , so I think you 're very lucky to see this .
If some women are terrified when I showed up , you do n't have to tell me where I am right now , but then I 'm going to know through Twitter .
I realized I was very lucky to be able to change what you thought about me for 10 seconds .
Not everybody has the chance to do this .
These high-heeled shoes are uncomfortable , and I 'm not going to bring them .
The worst part is to put this long round of applause through my head because you can laugh at me , so do n't do anything when it s on my head .
All right .
Why do I do that ?
It s really weird .
In fact , the hope is that it s not so unusual as this picture .
It s very powerful , but it s also very artificial .
I 've just changed everything you think about me for six seconds .
And in this photograph , I actually did n't have a boyfriend in real life .
I was very uncomfortable at that point , and the photographer told me to use his back and put my hand on his hair .
And of course , unless it s surgery , or the artificial skin that I 've had two days ago to photograph , there are very few things that we can do to change our external appearance , and our appearance , even though it s fake and difficult to change , it has a huge impact on our lives .
So today , to me , there s nothing to be afraid of being real .
And I 'm standing on this stage because I 'm a model .
I stand on this stage because I 'm beautiful , a white woman , and in the model , we call it a sexy girl .
And I 'm going to answer questions that people are always asking me , but with the truth .
The first question is , how do I become a model ?
And I always said , Oh , I 'm detected , but it does n't mean anything .
I 'm actually a model because I win the genetic lottery , and I 'm a legacy agent , and you might be wondering what inheritance is .
In the last few decades , we 've identified beauty not only as healthy and young and young , and the symmetrical that we 've been programmed in biology to aspire , but as height , the bars and the white , the white .
This is the legacy that was built for me , and that s the legacy that I made money out of it .
I know that some of you have this skepticism , and maybe there are some people who are dressed like , Wait . Naomi . Tyra . Joan Smalls . Liu Wen .
I want to urge you to understand your models . It s very impressive .
But unfortunately I have to tell you in 2007 , a Ph . D . student at the University of New York who posted it was all of the models on the stage , and in 67 acres that were hired only 27 people , less than four percent , not white .
The next question that people always ask me is : Can you be a model when you grow up ?
And my first answer was : You do n't know , you 're not in charge of recruitment .
But the next answer I really want to tell these girls is : Why ?
You know ? You can become anyone .
You can become the president of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a cardiologist with cardiovascular artery , would be great , because you would be the first person to do it .
If , after an interesting list , they said , No , no , Cameron , I want to be a cyborg , and then I 'll say , Make your boss .
Because you have no power , and you can be a cross-section of the Vogue magazine in the U . S . or president of H & M , or Steven Meisel the future .
I said I wanted to be a model when I was growing up like I wanted to win a lottery ticket when I was growing up .
It s beyond your control , and it s great , but it s not a career path .
I 'm going to show you -- with 10 years of experience I 've accumulated when I 'm a model , because it does n't look like a cardiac surgeon , so it s just a short time .
If the photographer is standing here with the light , it s like a beautiful interaction , and then when the client says , Cameron , we want to take a picture of him walking , so this leg is going ahead , beautiful and long , this hand is going to hit the back , and then at first , the top of the three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at the back , and you imagine that your friends , 300 , 500 times , 500 times , 000 times more than that .
This is what it looks like .
Hopefully it s less expensive than the one in the middle .
I did n't know what was happening at the time .
Sadly after you 're done , you write a quécé and have done something else , you ca n't say anything else , because if you say you want to be President of the U . S . presidential president , but your quécé says , The hippie pattern : 10 years , people will look at you with the strange eye .
The next question that people were asking me was : Are all photos corrected ?
That s right , almost all of the photos are being edited , but that s just a small element of what s going on .
This is one of the first photos I ever photographed , which was the first time I photographed a bathroom , and I did n't even have a menstrual cycle .
I know that we 're going into the personal story , but I was a little girl .
This is what I looked like , photographing my grandmother a few months ago .
This is me in the same day doing this picture .
My grandmother went with me .
This is me at a dinner party a few days ago when he photographed for the French Vogue .
This is me with the football team in the magazine .
And this is me right now .
I hope you can see -- these pictures are not my image .
These are the images that were built , and they were created by a group of experts , hair makers , geeks , geeks , photographers , and all their sponsors , their sales , their products , and they created this . It s not me .
The next question that I get a lot of people ask is : What are you given for free ?
I have a lot of high heels that I never bring , which I never did , which is the exception , but the free that I get is the stuff that I have in real life , and that s the things that we do n't want to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and one time , I went to the store , and I forgot to take my money and they gave me a free bat .
When I was a teenager , I sat in a friend of mine who was a very scary driver , and she crossed the red light , and all I had done was to say , Sorry the police , and we can move on .
I get free stuff because of my appearance , not because I am and I have people who are willing to spend a lot of money on their appearance and not who they are .
I lived in New York , and last year , in the 140 , 000 adolescents that were taken , there were 86 percent black and Hispanic , mostly young adolescents .
In New York , only 177 , 000 black and Hispanic people , so for them , the question is n't , Am I arrested ?
It s how many times am I going to get arrested and when ?
When I was preparing this talk , I found that 53 percent of the 13-year-old girls in the U . S . do n't like their bodies , and that figure went up to 78 percent when they were 17 years old .
The last question that people ask me is : how does it feel to be a model ?
I think what they want to hear is that if you 're a little bit thinner , and your hair is slightly happier , you 'd be happy and happy .
And when we were in the back of the chicken wing , we came up with something like this .
It s great to travel , to work with creative , inspirational , inspirational people .
And these are facts , but that s only half , because what we never said before in front of the lens , which I never said before in front of the lens is : I 'm not secure .
I was safe because I had to think about my image every day .
And you ever wondered if your thighs were more elegant and your hair were more happy , so would I be happier ?
You just have to meet a group of people , because they have the best legs , the best hair and the best parts , and they can be the most safe women on the planet .
When I was writing this speech , I felt really hard to find the right balance , because on the one hand , I was very uncomfortable coming here to say , I got all of this because I was lucky enough to give , and it was n't going to make me happy .
But it s mostly hard to disrupt a legacy of gender and ethnicity while I 'm one of the biggest benefits .
But I 'm also happy and honored here , and I think it s been lucky that I 've been to the last 10 , 20 or 30 years , and I 've been working with a lot of companies in my career , because I can not tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wo n't talk about how I got my pension , which is so important right now .
If there s something that stays on this talk , I hope it s all of us that are more comfortable to acknowledge the power of the image in our sense of success and failure .
Thank you .
There are many ways that people around us can help improve our lives .
We do n't touch each other , so there s a lot of intelligence that s never known , even though we share public spaces .
So over the last few years , I 've been trying to share more ways to share with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like paperwork , hole and pollen .
And these projects came from the questions I asked , like , how much would my neighbors pay for their apartments ?
How do we borrow and borrow more things without typing each other s door at a bad time ?
How do we share more of our memories of abandoned buildings , and better knowledge about our landscape ?
And how do we share more of our hopes for vacant shops , so our communities reflect our needs and dreams ?
Now , I live in New Orleans , and I 'm in love with New Orleans .
My soul has always been curled up by giant , condurable trees , poisonous people and dreamers for hundreds of years , and I believe in the city that always create a place for music .
I felt like every time someone was scratching , New Orleans had a whole march .
Cities have some of the best architectural structures in the world , but it also has the largest number of rejected values in the U . S .
I lived near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a better place for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that would change my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost a very loving person .
Her name was Joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was unpredictable .
And I thought about dying a lot , and this makes me feel deep for the time I 've had , and it gives me clarity to what makes sense of my life now .
But I struggled to sustain this view of my everyday life .
I feel like it s easy to grasp through the day , and forget what really matters to you .
So with the help of the old and new friends , I translated one side of this abandoned building into a giant chalk of pollen and automated it with a kind of empty question : Before I died , I wanted to -- so that anyone across the passing through can pick a piece of pollen , reflect their own life , and share their own desires in public space .
I do n't know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day the wall was completely closed , and it continued to grow .
And I want to share some things about what people write on that wall .
Before I die , I wanted to try to steal .
Before I die , I wanted to be on the streets of International Day .
Before I die , I wanted to sing for millions of people .
Before I die , I wanted to grow a tree .
Before I die , I wanted to live outside the envelope .
Before I die , I want to be hugged again .
Before I die , I wanted to be someone s warrior .
Before I die , I wanted to be completely myself .
So this space has become an architectural space , and the hopes and dreams of people make me laugh , tears , and they console me during my hard times .
It s about knowing that you 're not alone .
It s about understanding the people around us in new and creative ways .
It s about creating space for reflects and experiments , and remember what really matters to us when we grow up and change .
I made this project last year , and I started getting hundreds of letters from people who wanted to make a wall in their community , so my central communities and I made a tool , and now the walls are done in countries in the world , including Kazakhastan , South Africa , Australia , Argentine and more .
Together , we 've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we are given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one other person .
The two most important things we have are time and relationships with others .
In an age of increasing our dispersal , this is more important than ever before to figure out how to maintain our perspective and remember that life is short and soft .
death is something we 're often not encouraged to talk about or even think about , but I 'm realizing that preparing death is one of the most powerful things you can do .
Think about death that makes you clear .
Our shared spaces can be better reflected on what happens to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share hope , fear and stories , people around us , not just to help us do better places , they can help us lead our lives better .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , I do the math that apps , and this is an unusual problem for anyone who does the math math , which is that we 're like the managers .
Nobody knew what we were doing .
So today I 'm going to try and explain to you what I do .
Well , dance is one of the activities that people do .
We love the master dancers of the Dalai Lama and Show you 'll see later .
Third challenge requires a special technical process and advanced technology and can be relevant to this procedure , which is genetically relevant .
Sadly , mental disorders like Parkinson s are destructing this special capacity , as it is happening to my friend Jan Stripling , who , for a while , once a ballet artist .
Throughout the last few years there has been tremendous progress in treatment .
However , 6 . 3 million people worldwide have disease , and they have to live in a situation of debilitating debilitating , trembling , inadequate , and other symptoms come with this disease . What we need is tools for a very clear goal to detect pathology before they 're too late .
We need to measure progress objective , and in the end , the only way that we know when we actually have a treatment , is when we have a proper method of being able to answer it .
But what s really frustrating is that with Parkinson s disease and other dynamic disorders , they have no biological footprint , so there s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best thing we have is this neural test .
You need to go to hospitals to do that . It s very expensive , which means this experiment is beyond clinical trials , it s never been done .
But what if the patient could do this at home ?
It would be really free to go to the clinic , and if the patient could do the test itself , what about that ?
It does n't take the gold time of the employees .
It s about 300 dollars , just to do this at the clinic , the neurosurgeon .
So what I want to propose to you is a nontraditional way through which we can achieve this , because , as you can see , at least in a certain way , we 're all masters like Jan Stripling friends of mine .
Here we have a video of the vibrating patterns .
The sound is healthy and someone is saying , and we can look at ourselves as musical dancers , because we have to coordinate all the musical organs in creating sound , and we all have genes for that . For example , FoxP2 .
It s like three goats that need special training .
I mean , think about how long it took a kid to speak .
From sound , we can actually track the position of the sound when we vibrate , when the devices are influenced by Parkinson s , the sound organs are too .
So in the bottom graph , you can see an example of the abnormal vibration of the wire .
We see the same syndrome .
We see the shake , the debilitating and hard .
The speech got more anxious and more wind after a while , and that s one of the symptoms of it .
These sound effects can be really hard to detect , in some cases , but with any kind of digital technology , and using precise speech analytics combined with the latest machine knowledge , we can now quantify exactly where someone lies in the continually between health and disease just using the same voice .
So how do the tests based on this voice compare to a clinical trial ? Both of them do n't interrupt each other .
Neuroscience has no invasion . They all use existing infrastructure .
You do n't have to design a whole new hospital system to do this experiment .
And both of them are accurate . But one more thing , experiment based on non-technical voices .
That means it can be done by itself .
The rapid pace , it took about 30 seconds or so .
It s extremely low cost , and we all know what s going to happen .
When something gets really cheap , it gets widespread .
So these are some of the great goals that I think we can do right now .
We can reduce the need for the patient .
It does n't have to go to the clinic to check the semester .
We can actually look at the high frequencies to get the data targeted .
We can employ a lot of managers at a very low cost to do clinical trials , which is the demographic on the scale of the population for the first time .
We had the opportunity to start looking for the first biosignature of the disease before it was too late .
So in order to do the first steps towards this , we 're making the Parkinson s Lab .
With Aculab and Patientstststsburgh LikeMe , we aimed to record the voice with a very large number of global quantities of data to collect enough data and begin to process four goals .
We have local residents who can reach out to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Anyone who s healthy or Parkinson s disease can call it cheap , and leave it on , a few cents a day , and I 'm really happy to report that we 've achieved six percent of the goal in eight hours .
Thank you .
Tom Rielly : So Max , by taking all the models that say 10 , 000 people , can you tell who s healthy and who s not ?
What do you get from these patterns ?
Max Little : Yeah . So what happens is , when you call you have to figure out whether you have a disease or not .
You see , some might not do that . Maybe they ca n't call it .
But we 're going to take a large amount of samples of data that are collected from all different cases , and the results are in different cases , because then we 're going to look at solving the compounds of the disease , and look for the actual signals of this disease .
So what s exactly 86 percent right now ?
That s much more than that .
In fact , my students Thanasis , I have to praise him , because he did some amazing work , he proved that this could be done through mobile phones , and that s where it s 99 percent .
Ninety-nine . Yes , a big progress .
So what that means is that people will be able -- people can call from their mobile phone and do this test , and people with Parkinson s disease can call them , record their voice , and then doctors can examine their health , see their health when they bring it to disease .
Exactly .
Thank you very much . It s Max Little .
Thank you very much , Tom .
I lived in the South .
This is the South : the wine shop , fast food , wildlife .
So the city planners came together and they decided to change the name of South China to make a different sense . So they changed into Southern Los Angeles Langeles , as if that would solve the real problems that are happening in the city .
This is in Southern Los Angeles .
The wine store , fast food , wildlife .
Like 26 . 5 million other Americans , I live in a food desert in Southern Los Angeles , the home of a fast food store across the street and the accident and ran away .
Interestingly , fast food on the road is killing more people than accidents and running away .
In Southern Los Angeles , people are dying of diseases that are treatable .
For example , the rates of obesity in my area are five times higher than Beverly Hills , for example , that s about 16 kilometers away .
I was bored to see this happening .
And I wondered , how do you feel when you do n't have a healthy food , when every time you get out of the door , you have to see the bad effects that the food system does for where you live ?
I saw the wheelchair being sold just like the old automobile .
I see blood filters grow as many as Starbucks .
And I realized it had to stop .
I realized the problem was the solution .
Food is a problem and food is a solution .
And I also felt so frustrated to drive 45 minutes to buy an apple that does n't belong to the depth .
What I did was I planted a food forest in front of my house .
It s on a series of land that we call a voyage walk .
It s about three feet wide , 50 feet long .
The problem is , that land is about the city .
But you have to look at it .
So I thought , Great . I can do what I want , because that s my responsibility and I have to look at it .
And this is how I look at that land .
I 'm with my team , L . A . , we 're gathering together and we 're starting to grow the food forest : fruit , you know , all nine vegetables .
We 're a group of haters sharing hatred , including gardeners from all over the city , and they 're completely autonomous , and everything we do is free .
And the garden , it s beautiful .
Then someone complained .
The city came to me , and it was kind of like giving me a work , asking me to break my garden . The story then became the citadel of the court .
And I was like , Come on , really ?
A bowl of buildings for crops on the land that people do n't care about ?
And I said , Okay . Come here .
Because this time it s not .
And then L . A . posted , Steve Lopez wrote a paper about it , and he was talking to the committee of the board , and then one of the members of the blue land sent a petition to Change . org , and with 900 letters , we succeeded .
We had a victory in our hands .
The council of the council even called back and said that they celebrated and liked what we were doing .
I mean , okay , why not ?
L . A . led America to the wilderness of the city owned .
They have 42 kilos of abandoned land .
That s the equivalent of 20 times the central park .
It s enough to grow 725 million tomato sauce .
How do they not agree ?
Planting a tree will give you 1 , 000 , 10 , 000 seeds of seeds .
When the amount of blue beans cost you a dollar for the equivalent of 75 dollars .
That s my God , when I told people , grow your own food .
His own food propellant is exactly the same for money .
I had legacy in Southern China .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
And I refused to do part of this reality , which was created for me by some other people , and I 'm creating my own reality .
I 'm an artist .
Make a garden is my art . I grew my work .
Just like an artist , the person who makes the wall , I , I 'm making the point for the lawns , the voyage .
I used the garden , which is a canvas , and the trees and trees are what I made of that canvas .
You 'd be surprised by what the land can do if you turn them into canvas .
You ca n't imagine how great the sunflowers are , and how they affect people .
So what happened ?
I witnessed my garden as an education tool , a tool for the transition of my neighborhood .
In order to change the community , you have to change the components of the land .
We are the land .
You 'd be surprised to see how kids are affected .
Make a garage is the most powerful and most challenging work you can do , especially in the inner .
And by the way , you get a brown one .
I remember once , there was a mother and daughter coming , which was about 10 : 30 p . m . and they were in my garden , and then I went out and they were embarrassed .
I thought , Oh my God , I 'm so bad that they 're there , and I said to them , you know , you know , you do n't have to do that .
This garden is on the road for its reason .
I was so embarrassed to see someone who was so close to me and still was so hungry , and it was only the more reason I could do this . People asked me , Fin , do n't you fear people would steal your food ?
I said , Of course not , I 'm not afraid they 're going to steal .
So they 're just on the street .
That s the whole idea .
I wanted them to get them , but at the same time , I wanted them to get their health back .
There was another time when I was a garden in a homeless neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles .
There were men , and they made me tick from the van .
The air was very happy , and they shared stories about gardening that affected them , and they used to grow their mother s vegetables , with her former mother , and it was great to see that the idea had changed them , even in that moment .
So the green pieces have continued to grow about 20 pieces of gardens .
We had about 50 people coming into dig , and they were all volunteers .
If they grow their food , they 'll feed their food .
If they grow their tomato , they 'll eat their tomato .
But if no one s showing them that , if they do n't see the effects of food on the mind and the body , they 're blind to eat whatever s in front of them .
I see young people who want to work , but they 're busy doing something -- I see them colorful , and they just follow the path that s already already already already available , and they do n't lead to it .
With gardening , I see an opportunity that we can guide kids to contain their communities , and there s a sustainable life .
And when we do that , who knows ?
Maybe we 'll produce the next George Washington Carver .
But if we do n't change the component of the land , we 'll never do that .
This is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I wanted to grow a whole garden where people could share food .
I wanted to take away the container tentacles and turn them into a cafeteria that was healthy .
Do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about free stuff , because free is not sustainable .
The interesting thing about sustainability is that you have to sustain it .
I 'm talking about jobs for people , and dragging kids out of the street , and giving them joy , pride and honor to grow their own food , open markets for farmers .
What I want to do here , we 're going to make it very provocative .
I want us all to be the greener , the craftsmen .
We 're going to change the concept of fiber fiber .
If you 're not a gardener , you 're not a bug .
Make a sargassum with your glove , OK ?
And let s turn it into the weapon you choose .
It s basically , if you want to meet me , you know , if you want to meet me , do n't call me if you want to sit on the chair and sit in meetings where you talk about doing this and do this and do it .
If you want to meet me , go out into the garden with your candle and we 'll grow something .
Hi . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya in the south of Nairobi National Park .
The back of me is my father s cow , and behind the cow , is the Nairobi National Park .
The Nairobi National Park is not limited to the south area , which means that wild animals like horses come out of the park freely .
And so animals eat as lions after them , and this is what those lions do .
They kill our cattle .
This is one of the cows that was killed at night , and when I woke up in the morning I found it dead , and I felt very sad , because it was the only male that we had .
My community , the Maasai , believes that we 're from heaven with all of our animals and all of our land to keep them , which is why we 're so important to them .
So I grew up with a lion hatred .
The Masai warriors who protect our communities and cattle were also very concerned about this .
So they killed lions .
This is one of the six lions that was killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why lions in the Nairobi National Park are very few .
Every son from six to nine years old , in my community , is responsible for the blankets of my father , and I have to do the same thing .
So I had to figure out how to solve this problem .
The first idea I got was using fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
But then I realized that fire did n't really work , because it even helped lions see cows .
But I did n't give up . I kept thinking .
And my second idea was to use a hunch .
I tried to deceive those lions into the thought of Rio as I was standing near the cows .
But lions are smart .
They went to the first day and saw the goat look , and then they came back , but the second day , they came and they said , This is not moving , it s always there .
And then the lion came in and killed the cattle .
So one night , I took a kettle that went around the cow , and on that day , the lions did n't come .
I discovered that lions of light move .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a kid , I 'd been working in my room for a whole day , and I even launched my mother s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electricity .
So I took an old car battery battery , a billionaire , which was found in a car motorcycle , and it helped the person drive the motorcycle when they wanted to be left or right . It flashed .
And I have a switch that can turn off and open the lights .
And that s a little light from a broken cell .
And I put everything together .
As you can see , the solar panels that we use to charge the battery , and the battery inoculates energy to the measure box . I call it the transducer .
And the dashboard makes the light go off .
As you can see , the lights are coming out , because that s where lions come in .
And that s how the light is coming to the lion when they come at night .
The lightbulbs turned off and deceived lions made them think that I was walking around the cows , but actually I was sleeping in my bed .
Thank you .
I put it in my house two years ago , since then , we have n't had any problems with lions .
The neighbors heard about this idea .
One of them is this woman .
She had so many cattle that she had been killed , and she asked me if I could help her build the electric shadows .
And I said , Yes .
So I put the lights on . You can see on the back , they 're the lightbulbs .
So far , I 've managed to put seven families in my community , and they all work .
Now my idea has been used all over Kenya to excavate other predatory animals like hyenas , newspapers , and it s also used to threaten the farmer herd of the people .
Through this invention , I was very lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , International School of Brookhouse , and I was very excited about this .
My new medium is now beginning to help by raising and raising awareness .
I even took my friends about my community , and we set up a light for the families who did n't have access to it , and I taught them how to install them .
A year ago , I was just a boy in the cod department for my father , and I 'd seen airplanes , and I said to myself that one day , I would be sitting inside it .
And I 'm here today .
I had the opportunity to come here with an airplane for the first time to join TED .
My biggest dream was to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I was growing up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention was saving fathers ' cows and lions , we could live with lions without any conflict .
Ashthee . In my language , it means thank you very much .
I do n't know how interesting it is to hear my story .
So I had this scholarship . Yes .
You 're doing other electricity inventions .
What s the next invention in your list ?
My next invention , you want to make a fence of electricity . What about the power barrier ?
I know that the electricity fence is already invented , but I want to make my own .
You tried it , right , and I did . . . He did it before , but I stopped because of an electrical shock .
Richard Turere , I 'm so different .
We 're going to build your grandchildren on the way you go , small friends .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
What I did , and what I did as a teenager -- my life was shaped for seven years in Africa .
From 1971 to 1977 -- that s not how young I was -- I worked in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in their engineering projects with African countries .
I worked for the non-governmental organization of Italy , and every project that we created in Africa failed .
I was very cerebral .
When I was 21 years old , I thought , Italians are good people , and we 're working well in Africa .
But instead , we killed everything that we were in .
The first project , which was inspired by my first book , the light waves from Zambezi , was a project in which the Italian decided to teach the Zambia to the food .
So we were in southern Zambia with seeds from Italy in a beautiful valley that went down to Zambezi , and we taught the people the Italian tomato sauce and the secrets of Italy .
Of course , local people are not interested in doing this , so we pay them , and sometimes they come to work .
We were really amazed by the locals , in the fat valley like this , that there was nothing like this .
But instead of asking them why they did n't grow anything , we simply said , Thank God we were here .
It was time to save the Zambia from hunger .
And of course , things in Africa are going well .
We have these great tomato sauces . In Italy , a tomato sauce is about this big . In Zambia , it s this big .
It s incredible , and we said to the Zambia people , You know , there s this easy way to grow .
When the tomato sauce started to get , nine , and in red , just one night , about 200 of the anatomy from the glacier and clear everything .
We told the Zambia people , God , those cosmic galaxies !
And the people said , Well , that s why we did n't grow anything here .
So why do n't people tell us first ? Have you ever asked .
I thought there was just every Italian person in Africa who was doing this , but then when I looked at what the Americans were doing , the Brits were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I felt a little bit proud of my project in Zambia .
Because , you see , at least we also feed cosmic species .
You should look at something that s -- you should look at something that s undoubtedly hidden that we 've given to people of Africa who are not suspicious .
You want to read some of the books , read the Air Force , written by Dambisa Moyo , who is a Zambia economist .
The book came out in 2009 .
We , as Western aid countries , have brought to Africa 2 billion of us in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you what the amount of money has caused .
Let s find her book .
Stop it from a woman in Africa , the damage we cause .
People like us who are Westerners , who are educators , and we have only two ways to treat other people : either to support , or to protect , or to protect .
Two words are derived from the Roman Star , which means being a father .
They have two different meanings .
Conservatives , I treat anyone from other cultures as if they 're my child . I love them too much .
Asked , I treated people from other cultures like mine .
That s why white people in Africa are called bwana , the boss .
I was blown into the face of reading the book , little , beautiful , written by Schuperier , saying , above all , in economic growth , if others do n't need help , let s wear them .
This should be the first rule of aid .
The first commandment for aid is respect .
This morning , the leader of this meeting put a stick on the floor , and said , Can we imagine a city without a new demographic ?
When I was 27 years old , I decided to just respond to people , and I created a system called Enterprise Flig , where you would n't start anything you 'd never motivate , but be a very geeky person for the local aspiration , the people who had dreams to be a better person .
So you do -- you silence .
Do n't bring a community with ideas , you sit with the local people .
We did n't work from the offices .
We met in the cafeteria . The wine .
We have no infrastructure .
And what we did was we became friends , and we figured out what that person wanted to do .
The most important thing is desire .
You can give someone an idea .
If that person does n't want to do it , then how do you do it ?
Women s desire for their own growth is the most important thing .
The desire for men s personal growth is the most important thing .
And we helped them do their own search for knowledge , because nobody in the world can do it by themselves .
People with the uncertainty of ideas , but knowledge always exists .
So many years ago , I had this idea : Why do n't we , just once , go to a community , and tell people what they should do , why should n't we , listen to them once ? But not in community meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There s a problem in public meetings .
Companies never come , and they do n't tell you , in a community meeting , what they want to do with their money , the opportunity they 've just figured out .
So there s this point of blindness .
The smartest people in the community , you never know , because they never went to public meetings .
What we do is we work on one-to-one and to do that , you have to create a structure that does n't exist .
You have to create a new industry .
A new industry is like a family doctor for your business , family doctors for your business , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , and helps you find resources to turn your desires into a way of making life .
I started as a test in Esperance , West Australia .
I was doing a Ph . D . at that point , trying to get out of the way that the conservation approach was coming and telling you what to do .
So what I did in the first year in Esperance was just the encyclopedia on the street , and in the three days I had the first client to a fish job in my garage , the name of Maori , and I helped him sell him to a restaurant in Perth , and I held a job , and then a fisherman came up to me and said , Did you help me ? Can you help me ?
And I helped these fishermen know how to work together and sell these perfect tuna not to the box plant in Albany for 60 hours , but we found a way to sell them to Japan for 15 dollars a signature , and the farmers came together , and they said , Hey , could you help us ?
For a year , I had 27 links and government s people to come up to me and ask me , How do you do that ?
He did this -- and I said , I did a really hard job .
I was silent , and I listened to them .
So -- So the government says to me , Let s do it again .
We 've done that in 300 communities around the world .
We helped start 40 , 000 jobs .
There s a new generation of entrepreneurs who are exhausted from isolation .
Peter Drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died when he was 96 years old , a few years ago .
Peter Drucker was a philosopher before working on business , and this is what Peter Drucker said : It really does n't match a society and a business economy .
It s supposed to be a dead marriage for the business .
So right now you 're rebuilding Qchurch without knowing that the smartest people in church want to do what their own money and their own potential .
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you .
You have to give them security , privacy , you have to be really excited to help them , and they will come , in the crowd of twists .
With a 10 , 000 people , we can have about 200 clients .
Can you imagine a 400 , 000 people , intelligent and aspirational community ?
What s the most powerful lecture you 've ever given this morning ?
The locals , the people you aspire . These are the people you clapped for .
So what I 'm talking about is the Business Company is where it s present .
We 're at the last stage of the Industrial Revolution -- with unrebuilt fuel sources , and all of a sudden , we have unsustainable systems .
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
Freon s way to store things is not sustainable .
What we have to look at is how to nurture , treat , education , move and connect to seven billion people in sustainable directions .
There s no technology to do that .
Which one will invent the technology for the green revolution ? The universities ? Forget about it !
Government ? Forget !
They 're going to be identities , and they 're doing it right now .
There s a very funny story that I read in a magazine many years ago .
There s a group of experts invited to discuss the future of New York City in 1860 .
And in 1860 , the group of people who came together and figured out what happened to the city of New York over the next 100 years , and the conclusion was that the city of New York will no longer survive in the next 100 years .
Why ? Because they looked at the curves on the graph and said , if the population continues to grow in this scale , to move a population of New York City , they would need six million horses , and the waste from six million horses would have no way to deal with it .
They would be plastered in horses .
So in 1860 , they saw this dyed technology that caused life in New York City .
So what happened ? In the next 40 years , until the year 1900 , in the U . S . , there was about 1 , 000 a car manufacturing firm .
The idea of finding a different technology has gone all the way up and there are very small factories in a state of stagnation .
Dearborn , MIchigan . Henry Ford .
However , there s a secret to working with entrepreneurs .
First of all , you have to give them security .
No , they wo n't come and talk to you .
Then you have to give them an absolute , separate and enthusiastic service .
And then you have to tell them the truth about business .
The smallest company , the biggest company , has to have the ability to do three great things : The product you want to sell is perfect , you have to have the best promotional strategy , and you have to have the perfect financial stewardship .
Think about that ?
We 've never met an individual in the world who s just been able to make it , sell it and manage it at the same time .
That does n't exist .
This character has never been born .
We did a study , and we looked at 100 of the world s typical companies , Carnegie , Westinghouse , Edison , Ford , all new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There s only one thing that all successful companies in the world have , and only one thing that is this : There s not a company that starts with one person .
We now teach businesses for 16-year-old adolescents in Northumberland how many times we started class by giving them the first two pieces of Richard Branson s history , and the work for these 16-year-old ages was low , in the first two pages of Richard Branson s biography , how many times Richard Branson and how many times Richard Branson used me and how many times he used the word we used .
There was never a word I had , and since we had 32 times .
He did n't start alone .
Look who started a company alone . No one .
So we can create a community where the donors have an underlying experience of how small business is sitting in the cafe , the alcohol , and your dear friends , who will do what someone else has done for them to talk about this hero who s going to ask you , what do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you do it ?
OK , can you sell it ? Can you manage the money ?
Oh , no , no , I ca n't do this . Do you want me to find somebody else for you ?
We activate communities .
We have teams that volunteer to help Enterprise Facitator , they help find resources and people , and we found that the magic from people s intelligence , like something like you can challenge the culture and the economy of this community just by holding the desire , the source of energy and imagination and imagination like your people s people .
Thank you .
Up until March , 2011 , I was a photojournalist in New York City .
We are these green creatures .
It s in the dark , windowless room , and in general , avoid sunlight .
We made it better , better skin , make it possible , and we always got criticism in the newspaper , but we also had brilliant artists with years of experience and real understanding of images and photography .
In November 2011 , watching the world s situation at home , I saw tragic events happening in Japan .
Then , the volunteer organization that I joined all Hands Volunteers , for the next few days , came to the scene of the endeavor effort .
I , along with hundreds of volunteers , understood that it was impossible to sit still at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On May 13 , I found my way to the town of Ahfunato .
It was a small village in Iwate , with a population of about 50 , 000 people , one of the first places that was affected by the tsunami .
The water in this country has been recorded over 24 meters , and it s gone over three miles deep into the land .
You can imagine , the town was devastated .
We pulled the fragments from the channel , the hole .
They cleaned up the schools , hygiene the houses , ready for innovation and rehabilitation .
We cleaned up tons of crust and sweat from the local fish plant .
We 're lexicobos , but everybody s happy .
For weeks , volunteers and local people were looking for something .
They were looking for photos and albums and photos and SD cards .
It all did .
They collected and discussed them to protect in places around the world .
It was n't that moment that I realized these pictures were such a big personal loss in these people .
When they ran out of the tsunami , to keep their lives , they left everything , everything was left behind .
At the very beginning of the first week there , I went to help a sustainable center in the city .
I was able to clear up the hot water , public heating , huge showers .
This is also where the mobile center collected images .
This was a place where people were interacting with them , and I was honored that day , because they believed that I could let them wipe out pictures .
It was very emotional and excitement . Before that , I had heard that I had to think out of the framework , but only if I really experienced that , it just happened .
When I look at the pictures , there are some pictures that have been around for over a hundred years , some of them still in the envelope from the studio . I think , as a photographic advisor I can fix the lips and the shoes , and I know , hundreds of others can do that .
So that night , I got access to Facebook and I got some people , and I got a lot of positive feedback , I knew I had to start working .
We started to edit these pictures .
This is the first one .
It does n't break down , but it s perfume that makes her face color change , has to be corrected with accuracy and complexity .
Without that , the girl in the picture would n't look like her , and it certainly was as bad as the image was .
Over time , very luckily , many pictures are coming back , and I need more edits , so again , I went to Facebook and LinkedIn , for the next five days , I found 80 people who wanted to help from 12 different countries .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people who wanted to participate .
In Japan , in July , we expanded Rikuzentakentakata s neighborhoods , far north to the town of Yamada .
Every week , we put our scanned scanned scanner in the temporary photo library that was established before , so that people would come back with their photos .
Older women have sometimes never seen a scanner , but after 10 minutes , looking for a picture of their loss , giving us a scanner , uploading to a cloud , to download it by a gaijin , a stranger , somewhere in the world , and starting to get edited .
The time spent restoring the state is a completely different story , and it s obviously dependent on the loss of the image .
It could take an hour . It could take all week .
It can take months .
The kimono in this image has to be painted by hand , or grafted , from the color and the details that have never been damaged .
It takes time .
Now , all of these images have been damaged by water , crushed in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes in oil , and for a while they 'll continue to hurt . So it s a very large part of the project .
We ca n't fix it if the image is not clean , dry and retrofitting .
We were lucky with lasers with hand .
There was a great local woman who led us .
It s very easy to add damage to these damaged images .
My team Wynne once said , It s like tattoos for somebody .
You do n't have the opportunity to make mistakes .
The women brought us these photographs had been lucky , when they could be recovered so much .
She wiped it out and stopped recognizing that she was going to hurt more .
You also have a copy of the picture .
Otherwise , places like her husband and face would never be consolidated , could only put them together in a different photograph , and reconstruct the entire image .
When she regained photos from us , she shared a little bit of her story .
These pictures were found by her husband in a firestorm , between the fragments of the long distance since there was a house that had been destroyed , and they realized him .
The day of the tsunami , he was responsible for the tsunami .
He had to go towards the water flow when the alerts were coming up .
Two little boys , now in no small age , both of them are in school , two different schools .
A child was stuck in the water .
It took them a week to find out that they had all survived .
The day I returned to her , she was also the day of her 14-year-old son .
For her , after all , these pictures were the perfect gift for him , something it could be reviewed , to remember the past that had never been seen before , to remember the day of March , when all life had been reversed or destroyed .
After six months in Japan , 1 , 100 volunteers joined the entire Hands Foundation , including hundreds of people who had been wiped to wipe out more than 135 , 000 pictures , most — — — most of them came back with their owners , which is a very important thing .
Over a hundred years of global volunteers helped pay more than 90 families , hundreds of photos were completely recovered and repaired .
In this time , we did n't spend a thousand dollars on equipment and materials , most of the cost was for the printer ink .
We took pictures all the time .
Every picture of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
They 're the ones that store our memories and narratives , the last thing that we hold up and that s the first thing that we come back to look for .
That s the point of this whole project , restoring small pieces of humanity , bringing back connections to somebody else .
When a picture like this is paid , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the receiver .
The project also makes a huge difference in the lives of the photojournalists .
For some people , they were connected to something bigger , to something else , to something else , to something other than the mustard and the leather .
I wanted to read an email to finish this talk . This is from Cindy , who s a help fix it , sent me back from Japan after six months .
When I was working , I could n't think of each and every single one of these stories contained in the photographs .
There was a photo that took generations of women in their homes , from old age to young , gathering around a child , was beating me , because my house had a similar photo , my grandmother , my mother , me , and my new daughter , the picture hanging on the wall .
On the other hand of the globe , no matter what time , our basic need is the same , right ?
Thank you .
I was in the depth of almost 50 feet under an illegal mine in Ghana .
The air is particularly dust and a little hot , and it s very hard to breathe .
I can feel the collision from the shadows swept through the dark , but I ca n't see anything more .
I heard the voice , but almost all of the tunnels are a mixture of the coughing and the limestone is broken with raw tools .
As people , I wear a cheap , low-cost batteries on my head , it s attached to the old rubber ring , and I ca n't see the staggering trees helping the walls of a giant 0 . 28 feet across the ground .
When I skied my hand , I was unreminded of the miner who had just seen a few days ago when his hand had been slipped into that tunnel .
When I talk to you today , these people are still in the hole , risk of life without salaries or hats , and often dead .
I was climbed out of that hole , and I was coming home , but they probably would never get home , because they had a slave .
For the past 28 years , I 've collected documentaries on local culture in over 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I 've had the privilege to become the only performer at the top of the Vancouver Schools .
One of the incredible talents I met there , I met a supporter of the Soviet Empire , a member of the NGO who deprived the modern slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and in fact , I started researching slavery because I knew it existed in the world , but not so much .
And after this talk , I found it really awful and really embarrassing to see this brutality in my life , and I thought , if I do n't know , how many people do n't know ?
It started to humble the podium , so a few weeks later , I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the Empire and asked them to help them .
And since then , this journey has begun to go into the modern slavery world .
Strange is that I 've been to a lot of these places .
Some places I looked like my house .
But this time , I want to see the truth being covered .
A very generous estimate tells us that more than 27 million people have been slaved into slavery in the world today .
The number of people that were taken out of Africa during the course of buying slaves across the Atlantic Ocean .
150 years ago , a slave was three times the price of an American worker .
That s equivalent to 50 , 000 U . S . dollars today .
But today , many generations of families are being enslaved across generations with an 18-dollar debt .
And amazingly , slavery generates more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world .
A lot of people were fooled by the great promise of good education , better work , just to see that they were forced to work without violence , and not escaping .
The rate today is serving the trade , the goods that slavers create , but the people who create them are considered to be waste .
The slavery is almost everywhere in the world , even though it s illegal everywhere .
In India and Nepal , I was sent to a brick .
This beautiful landscapes are like going into the ancient Egyptian world or the Stone of Dante .
It s wrapped up in temperature more than 54 degrees centigrade , men , women , all the families , all of the families , were covered in blindfolded dust , made like a machine , put them on top , up to 18 employees per time , and took them from the burning bikes to the trucks that were hundreds of meters away .
It s still because of the monotonous and exhaustive , they 're quietly working , over and over again , 16 or 17 hours a day .
Without food , now on vacation to eat , because of serious water loss , it s become normal to go to primary urbanization .
The wind and dust spread all over the place that my camera was so hot that it was impossible to touch the stop button .
Every 20 minutes , I have to run back to the wildlife car to wipe out the device and let them work under restorative temperatures , and when I sat there , I thought , I think , my camera s going to be treated much better than any other person .
Back in the rubble , I just wanted to cry , but the slang next to me quickly grabbed me and said , Lisa , do n't do that . Do n't do that .
He explained very clearly that expressions of emotions are very dangerous in this place , not to me , but to them .
I could n't help them directly .
I could n't give them any money , nothing .
I 'm not that citizen .
I can put them in worse circumstances than they are today .
I have to rely on the FEMA Foundation to work in the system to free them , and I believe they can .
For me , it has to wait to get home to really feel the pain .
In the Himalayas , I saw kids sticking stone over many miles of mountain terrain down the van waiting for the bottom line .
The ice sheets are bigger than the ones that bring them , the children picking them up with their heads using the skeleton of sticks , the rope and the fabric .
The overlapping of things is so extreme .
How do we create this evil thing , the rest that s going to happen ?
Some people do n't even know they 're being slaved into slaves , they do n't work 16 , 17 hours a day , because they just know that .
They had nothing to compare .
When this village requires freedom , slaves burn their homes .
These people do n't have anything , they die well , they want the front , but the woman in the middle of the town , and they call the woman in the middle of the town and they call everybody to preserve , and those who are in the current slavery help them get their own coal hire , so that now they can do their own work , but they can do it for themselves , and they can do it in free .
We often think about sex slavery when we hear the word slavery , and because of this collective consciousness , I 'm told that it s very hard to work in this particular industry .
In Kathmandu , I was covered by women who had been sexual slavery .
They took me down the stairs of stairs down to the dirty basement , in the blurry light .
This is actually not the reservations .
It s more like a restaurant .
The distribution restaurants , as known in the field , are places of rape .
Every place there s a small room , where slaves , women , with children and girls , some seven-year-old children , are forced to be rewarded for customers , for example , they buy more wine and food .
Every bedroom is dirty and dark , detected by the paint on the wall by the edge of the barrel and the curtain .
The person who s done this has often suffered a catastrophic abuse under their customers ' hands .
In that nearby dark angle , I remember the fear of explosion , and that moment , I just understood what it was like to be incarcerated in the hell .
There s only one way to go : the staircase from which I went in .
There s no backdoor .
There s not a big window .
These are people who have no escape hatch , when we talk about the topic of slavery , and we need to remember that slavery , including the slavery of sexual trade , which happens in the same place where we live .
Hundreds of thousands of people were enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , full of money in their homes , and the list was still long .
Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100 , 000 and 300 , 000 children in the U . S . are sold to sex slavery every year .
It s around us . We just do n't see it .
The textile industry is often thought of when it comes to slavery .
I went to many villages in India , where many of the families were enslaved in commercial trade .
This is the family portrait .
The black hands are the father , the blue hand and the red hand is his son .
They mixed the powder in big boxes , and they threw it in a solution that was filled with her hand , even though it was very toxic dye .
My translator told their story .
They said , We have no freedom .
But I still hope that someday we can leave this house and go somewhere else where we 're paid for the dough dyed .
It s estimated that more than 4 , 000 children are doing slavery in the Volta lake , the largest artificial lake in the world .
For the first time I went there , I went through one turn .
I feel like a family that s beating on the boat , two boys , a few boys , it seems logical , right ?
Wrong . They 're all slaved .
Kids were taken from their families , trade and lost , and they were forced to work on these boats at this lake , even though they did n't know how to swim .
This child is eight years old .
I was shaking when our boat came close , just afraid to sail through my tiny canoe .
He was terrified of falling into the water .
The branches were packed into the Volta lake , and the kids were tired of fear had been pumped into the water to get their tongue out .
Many of them were drowned .
What he remembered was that he was caught up in the lake .
Too scared of the owner , I did n't dare to flee , and because of being treated as a child , I kept on doing that to the smaller slaves that I ran .
I met these boys at 5 o'clock in the morning , when they were dragging the last net , but they were working for an hour .
At night it was cold and it was cold .
It s important to note that these networks are nearly 500 , 000 kites when they 're full of fish .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
Kofi was saved from a village .
I met him in the emergency room where the organization liberated the rehabilitation of the victims .
Here he s bathed in the wells , and the great news is , when you and I sit here today , Kofi have been brought together with his family , and more or less , the family has been invented to make a living and to keep the children safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of the ability .
What would you be if somebody would stand up and change your life ?
The car on the streets of Ghana , as well as the colleagues in the Environmental Proclamation , a friend of the canoe , a friend of nominee pedestrians that drove to the car and knocked into the window .
He told us to go down the road in the woods .
At the end of the road , he rushed us out of the car , and he said to the car right away .
And then just point at this blurry footprint and say , This is the way , this is the way to go . Go .
And in that way , we mapped the cushions , and after about an hour of walking in the woods , the trace had fallen in the water after the rains , so I got the camera tag up when we went down to the depth of the deep water .
After two hours , the trace around the empty space , and in front of us , we were an area that was filled with holes in the football field , and they were filled with slaves .
Many women have children on their back while they 're scratching the gold , and they 're flowing through the stream of the monopoly contaminated water .
The bank was used in the manufacturing process .
These miners were being enslaved in the basement in another part of Ghana .
When they got out of the basement , their people got wet by their own sweat .
I remember looking at their red eyes , their fatigue , because many people had been underground until 72 hours .
The tunnels went all the way to a hundred meters , and they put on these heavy stone bags to convert them to another area , where the rock was sliced out to get the gold .
Look , the stone strike seems to be full of healthy people , but when you look closer , there are fewer luxuries working in extreme circumstances , there are children .
They 're all victims of vulnerability , disease and violence .
In fact , many of these muscle capabilities would eventually look like this person , whose tuberculosis had fallen and infected in a few years .
This is Manuru . When his father died , he was taken to the mine working with the mine .
When the uncle died , Manuru admitted his debt , and was forced to slave the mine longer .
When I met , he worked 14 years on the mine , and the wound on the leg that you see here from a mine accident , a foot that was so heavy that the doctor said he had to get in .
On top of that , Manuru had T . B . , but still being caught up in the day in that tunnel .
And yet , he still dreamed of the freedom to go to school with the help of local activists like the Empire , and determined like this , present on the face of strangers , which I was overwhelmed with rehabilitation .
I want to slave the slave out of the light .
When I was working in this area , I brought a lot of candles , and with the help of the translator , I transmitted to people that I photographed that I wanted to light their stories and their circumstances , and when they were safe and I was safe to take these photos .
They know their image will be seen by the people out there , like you .
I want them to know that we 're going to prove to them , and we 're going to do anything we can to help them change their lives .
I really believe , if we look at other people as peoples , it would be very hard to delay crimes like slaves .
The images are not about yourself . They 're about people , who are real people , like you and me , all worthy of equal rights , honor and respect in their lives .
There was no day that I could n't think of these amazing people being buried . I had the great honor to meet them .
I hope that the images will wake up a source of power in the viewer , people like you , and hopefully that power will lightning , that fire will lift into the slavery , because without that light , the monster of the prison will continue to live in the dark .
Thank you very much .
