When I was a child , I thought that Korea was the best country in the world and I used to sing , We have nothing to envy .
I was very proud of my country .
In school , we spend a lot of time learning about the life of the Great I-Sung , but not much time learning about the external world , except that the United States , Korea and Japan are our enemies .
Although I 've been wondering how the outer world is , I still think I 'm going to live my whole life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changes .
When I was seven , I saw the public firing for the first time in my life , but I still thought my life was completely normal .
My family was not poor , and I had never been hungry .
But one day of 1995 , my mother brought home a letter from one of my sisters who worked with her mother .
It says , When you read these lines , the whole five of your people have no longer left in the world , because your whole family has had nothing to eat for two weeks .
It s all on the floor , and our bodies are so weak that they can feel like death is coming very close .
I was shocked .
Because it was the first time that I knew that my colony was suffering .
Soon after that , when I went to a gas station , I saw a horror scenario that I could never forget .
On the gas station is the dead body of a woman who s still holding a child and a child who just knows to stare at his mother s face .
But nobody is helping them , because they 're all concerned with themselves and their families .
In the mid-90s , North Korea went through a severe famine .
It causes more than a million Koreans to die in hunger , and more people only survive to eat grass , pests and shells .
Electricity was happening more and more frequently , so everything around me was going to sink into the dark when it came to the dark side of the night except for the light from the Chinese side , just how my house was a river .
I always wondered why they had electricity , and we did n't .
This is a picture from the North Korea satellite at night in relation to the countries around .
This is the Austrian River , which is the natural border between North Korea and China .
You can see that the river is very narrow , so some North Koreans will transcend to China .
But a lot of people died .
And I saw exactly what they were floating on the river .
I can not tell you how I got rid of North Korea in the difficult years of famine , I was sent to China to live with a close relatives .
I just thought I was going to have to stay away from my family for a short time .
I can never imagine that I was going to have to be away from them for 14 years .
In China , the life of a girl is separated from the family like me is very difficult .
I had no idea what happened to a refugee s life from North Korea , but I soon realized that it was not only difficult , but it was extremely dangerous , because the refugees from North Korea in China were considered to be illegal immigrants .
I always lived in a constant fear that my identity would be discovered , and I would be returned to the old life in North Korea .
One day , that nightmare came true , I was arrested by the Chinese police and led to the police station to question .
Somebody told them that I 'm North Koreans , so they tested my Mandarin capacity and asked me a lot of questions .
I was terrified , and I felt like my heart was about to explode .
Because if they saw anything unnatural , I would get in jail and get back to water .
I think my life is over , but I still try to control my emotions and answer their questions .
After asking , one of the two cops said to the other , This is a case of just the wrong grade .
It s not North Koreans .
And they released me . It was a magic .
Some North Koreans have been to China s embassy for refugee assy , but many of them have been arrested by the Chinese police and returned to the water .
These girls were very lucky .
Because it was arrested , it was finally released by the pressure of the international community .
But these North Koreans are not so fortunate .
Every year , there are plenty of North Koreans arrested in China and returned to the water , where they 're tortured , or executed .
While I was very lucky that I was released , a lot of my people could n't have been that way .
The North Koreans have to cover their identity and fight to survive is a tragedy .
Even when they learn Chinese and find a job , their life can be completely reversed in a moment .
That s why , after 10 years of mask my identity , I decided to take my way to South Korea , to start a new life again .
It s much more difficult to stabilize life here than I ever imagined .
Because in Korea , English has a very important position , so I started to learn English , my third language .
I also realized a huge gap between South Korea and North Korea .
We 're all Koreans , but we 've become very different from the consequences of 67 years of separation .
I went through a crisis of my origins .
I 'm Korean or North Korea ?
Where do I come from ? And who am I ?
Suddenly , I did n't have a country to be proud of called the National Organization .
Despite having adapted to Korean life , it was n't easy , but I set up a plan .
It started to learn to prepare for the universities .
However , as soon as I was familiar with life here , I was told a terrible news .
The North Korean government discovered the amount of money I sent back to my family , and , in order to punish , they would force my family to move to a divorced area in the countryside .
So as soon as they can get out , I started planning to get my family out of the way .
The North Koreans had to overcome these incredible spaces of freedom .
Because it s almost impossible to cross from North Korea to South Korea , so I have to fly to China and go back to the North Korea border .
Because my family did n't know Chinese , so I had to go with people through 2 , 000 miles in China and go to Southeast Asia .
It was about a week of bus expedition , and we were almost caught up .
Once , our car was stopped and was discovered by a Chinese police .
He proved everybody s letter , and he started investigating .
Because my family did n't understand Chinese , I thought they would be arrested .
When the Chinese police came up to them , I immediately got up and said to him , These are the deaf people I 'm going to have to go with .
He looked at me suspiciously , but fortunately he believed me .
And we kept going to the side of the chop , but I had to spend nearly the entire amount of money I had on bribing for the grassroots guards .
However , after we crossed the border , my family was arrested for cross-border crime .
So after I applied the fine penalty and took the bribes , my family was released in a month , and I was arrested again in the capital of Portugal .
It was the most despairing moment in my life .
I did all sorts of ways to take my family to freedom , and we were almost successful , but they were caught while we had only how the Korean ambassador was so short .
I went back in the middle of the room to the police department and to the police , hoping to find a way to get my family out of there , but I did n't have enough money to bribe bribed or pay for it .
I was completely despair .
At the same time , a man said to me , What s going on ?
I was so surprised when a total stranger was interested in the question that I was .
With his lightweight English and a dictionary , I told him the context of my family . Not at all , that man went to ATM .
I thanked him with my whole heart , and I also asked him , Why do you help me ?
I did n't help her , and he said , He said .
' I 'm helping North Koreans .
I realized it was a very , very significant moment in my life .
The good line from strangers became a new hope symbol for me and the North Koreans when we needed it , and he showed me the kindness from strangers and the support of the international community was the kind of hope that the North Koreans were looking for .
Finally , after a long journey of me and my family had been reunited in Korea , but to reach for freedom was only half of the struggle .
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they get to a different country , they have to start with very little or very little money .
So we can get help from the international community for education , for English training , for profession , and for many other areas .
We can also act as a bridge between people who are in North Korea with the outside world , because there are so many of us who are communicating with other families in the country , and we share the information and the money to change North Korea from the inside .
I was incredibly lucky to get a lot of help and be inspired throughout my life , so I wanted to be able to bring my country an opportunity to develop with international support .
I believe you 're going to see more and more North Koreans succeeding everywhere in the world , even on the TED stage .
Thank you .
Today I only have one request .
Do n't tell me that I 'm normal .
Now I want to introduce you to my brothers .
Remi is 22 years old , coat and beautiful .
I ca n't speak , but I do convey joy in a way that even some of the best rhetoric can not do .
Remi knows what love is .
I 'm going to do it in an unconditionable way .
He s not greedy . He s not colorful .
I do n't care about religious differences , and understand : He never lied .
When she sings songs from our childhood , trying to remember the words I could n't , he reminded me of me of the thing : we know how much brains are , and what we do n't know how great they are .
Samuel is 16 years old . She s tall . He s also beautiful .
I have a perfect memory .
But it s also selective .
I do n't remember if you were able to whirl my chocolate swallow , but you remember the five findings of every single song on my iPod , the conversations between us since I was four years old , put on my hand on Teletubbies on my first wavelength , and Lady Gaga s birthday .
It sounds great , does n't it ?
But most people do n't agree .
And in fact , because their minds do n't fit in the normal social version , they 're often given and misunderstood .
But what makes my heart tick more relief and my soul more powerful is that , although this is true , even though they 're not considered normal , it can only mean that they are extraordinary -- individuals with autism and extraordinary people .
For you not very familiar with the phrase autism ' it s a brain disorder that affects social contact , learning and sometimes physical possibilities .
Remi is very different from one individual , and that s why Remi is very different from Sam .
And all over the world , there s one more person diagnosed with autism , and even though it s one of the fastest growing disorders in the world , we do n't know why or treatment .
And I could n't remember the first time that I was approaching autism , but I could n't remember one day without it .
I was three years old when my sister was born , and I was so excited that there was a new person in my life .
And after a few months , I realized that I was different .
I scream a lot .
I do n't want to play like other babies , and in fact , he does n't seem to enjoy me or something else .
Remi lives and admits in his own world , with his own rules , and I find joy in the smallest , like putting cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything in my hands .
As he grew up , he became more and more different , and the difference became clearer .
But beyond the outrage and outrage and excitement and irritation are something really unique : a pure and naive instinct , a boy who sees a life without prejudice , a person who never deception .
Africa is often done .
Well , I ca n't deny that there were some tough moments in my family , the moments I wish they were like myself .
But I took my memory back to what they had taught me about character , communication and love , and I realized that these are things that I would n't trade to get normal .
The average ignored beauty that the differences give us and the fact that we 're different does n't mean that one of us has anything wrong .
It just means there s one ' it s another .
And if I can only convey one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you , that s that you do n't have to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Since we have autism or not , the difference between us -- we have a gift ! Everyone carries in us a gift , and frankly , chasing the normal is the greatest potential .
The opportunity for great , progress and for change to collapse when we 're trying to become like someone else .
Let s not say I 'm normal .
Thank you .
You may all agree with me that this is a beautiful road .
It s built out of asphalt , and the asphalt is a garage that runs on it is very smooth , but it s not always true , especially not these days when it rains a lot .
Then you can get water on the way .
And especially if you ride a bicycle , and through these cars , it s not good .
Also , the asphalt also causes a lot of noise .
It s a noisy material , and if we make paths like the Netherlands , very close to the cities , we want a quiet road .
The solution to the problem is to make paths from the tire plastics .
The porous road is the material we 're using now to build almost every single country in the Netherlands , and it has holes and water just permeates through the hole , so all the rainwater is going to come out of every other side , and you have a road to drive . So there s no water relief anymore .
And noise also disappears through the hole .
Because it s so empty , all the noise is going to disappear , so the road is very quiet .
There s still a lot of inconvenience , and the inconvenience of this street is that the cracks , the bubbles can happen .
What is the cracks ? You see on this street you see the bubbled with bubbles .
First you get a rock , then more , more , more , more , more , and then they -- there , I wo n't do that .
But they can break your car lens . So you 're not happy with that .
And then , after all , this cracked bubble is going to hurt more and more .
Sometimes they make chicken nuggets .
Oh . He s ready .
So chicken , of course , may be a problem , but we have a solution .
So , really , you see here how disruptive this material is .
It s porous plastic , as I said , you only have a small amount of glue attached between the stone .
Under the effects of the weather , the solar radiation , this plastics oxygen , this bitum is sticky between these collections that constrict , and if you contract , it s going to have these extremely small cracks , and then you get away from the collections .
And if you drive up there , you 're going to destroy these collections -- as we 've just seen here .
In order to address this , we 've created self-assembly materials .
If we make this self-assembly material , then we can find solutions .
What we can do is we can take a steel thighs and we can wash up the wasp , and we can crumble the steel thighs in fact , and we can mix these little bits with bitum plastics .
So we have this asphalt that mixes with very small steel debris .
Then you need a machine , as you can see here , to cook -- a verb sensor .
The reaction can be thermal , especially steel can be very good .
What you do is you heat up the steel , you melt the bitum , and the bitum will flow into these little cracks , and the stone will stick on the back layer .
I 'm using a microwave oven today because I ca n't get the sensor from the background to the stage .
And microwave waves have the same system .
I 've put a prototype in the oven , and now I 'm going to take it out , and I 'm going to check it out .
This is a prototype that was taken out .
I said we invented an industrial machine like this in the lab to heat samples .
At the lab we 've tried many samples , and then the government , they 've actually seen the results , and they say , Oh , that s great . We have to try that .
Then they gave us a freeway , which was 400 meters across A58 , where we had to build this new material test .
So that s what we 've been doing here . You look at the pathway that we 've been doing , and then of course it s going to last for years without any damage . That s what we 've been learning from the experiment .
We 've taken lots of samples from this street and we 've tried them in the lab .
So we 're aging the specimen , put a lot of load on it , put it together with a verb sensor , put it back together and then try it again .
We can do this over and over again .
And in fact , the conclusion from this research is that if we nurture the four years path by a junction device -- this is a large version of the size that we 've built for real life -- if every four years we preserve the road once , we can double the length of the road . Of course we 'll save a lot of money .
Well , in order to wrap it up , I can tell you that we 've created a material that uses steel fiber , adding steel fibers , using magnetic heat , to actually increase the lifespan of the road , twice the amount of road expectancy is what even you can do , twice the amount of road expectancy with very simple terms , which will save a lot of money .
Now you may be wondering whether it works .
We also have a prototype here . It s quite warm .
It s supposed to be cooler before I just showed you the effect of a wellness therapy .
But let me try that .
Look at that . Yes , it s sticky .
Thank you .
I 'm here today to talk about a puzzle that the answer is as confusing as it is .
The theme is the secret to domestic violence , and the question I ask is the question that everybody always asks : Why is she here ?
Why should women stay with the person who beat them ?
I 'm not a psychiatrist , I 'm not a social worker or a family violence .
I 'm just a woman who wants to share her story .
I was 22 years old , I graduated from Harvard University .
I moved to New York City when I first did my first job to write and edit to Seventeen magazine .
For the first time , I had my apartment , my own American Express card , and I had a big secret .
The secret was , this gun was loaded with hollow-point bullet in my head because the man I thought was my partner , over and over again .
My man loves more than everyone shooting in my head and threatening to kill me how many times I ca n't remember it .
I 'm here to tell you about crazy love , a psychological trap that s camouflaged under the covers of love that millions of women and even some men have to spend every year .
This is probably your story .
I 'm not like a domestic violence consultant .
I got an English character from Harvard University , and I got marketing business from Wharton business school .
I have run out of my career in the top 500 companies like Johnson and Johnson , Leo Burnett and the Washington Times .
I married my second husband for almost 20 years and had three children together .
My dog is like Black Lab , and I drive the Honda Odyssey minivan .
So the first thing I want to tell you is that domestic violence happens to everybody , every religion , every level of income and education .
It happens everywhere .
And the second thing I want to say is that people think that domestic violence happens to women , that s the problem of women .
It s not true .
More than 85 percent of violence is men , and domestic violence happens in intimate , clogged , long-term relationships , in other words , in the family , where we want or expect to see that violence is a reason for domestic violence to be a problem .
I said to myself , I 'm the other man on the Earth who lives with the man who beat me , but in fact , I 'm a typical person of my age .
I 'm only 22 years old , living in the United States , a 16 to 24 year-old woman who is three times more likely to become a domestic victim of domestic violence than women at other age , and over 500 women and women at this age are killed every year by violence , a boyfriend , and a husband in the United States .
I was also a typical victim because I did n't know anything about domestic violence , warning or pattern .
I met Conor one night in January , rain and cold .
He was sitting next to me in the tunnel of New york , and he started talking to me .
He told me two things .
One was him , just like me , graduate from Ivy League and that he worked in a very impressive bank on Wall Street .
But the most impressive thing for me at the first meeting was that he was smart and he looked like a farmer .
He s got these big , big , big apple cheese legs and silk hair that look like the wheat field and he seems sweet .
One of the smartest things Conor did , since the beginning , is to create a sense that I 'm a promising relationship .
He did this remarkable thing at the beginning by appealing to me .
We started dating , and he fell in love with me every aspect that I was smart , that I chose Harvard , that I was passionate about helping young girls and work .
He wanted to know everything about my family and about my childhood , my hopes and dreams .
Conor believes me , as a writer and a woman in a way that no one has ever had before .
And he also creates the magical atmosphere of trust among us by admitting his secrets , that he s been so smart and he s been abused for almost 20 years by his staggering father , and the persecution has been bad for him to leave school at the age of eight , although he s so smart and he s almost 20 years to rebuild his life .
That explains why the degrees of Ivy Leage and work on Wall Street and his bright future means enormous to him .
If you tell me that this smart , funny , sensitive man , loved me one day when I was earned or not , how short my skirt was , where I lived , who was my friend and where I was born , who was my friend and where I was Christmas , I would laugh at you because there was no chance of a trace of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning .
I did n't know that the first stage in any family violence was tempting and sexy .
I did n't know that the second stage was a victim .
Now , Conor did n't come home one day and say , Hey , you know , all this Romeo and juliet are great , but I need to move to the next stage where I 'm isolated and inhibited her — So I need to take you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear her scream and go out of this city where my friends and family and colleagues can see the purple sections .
Instead , Conor came home on Friday night , and he said to me that he retired from work today on his dream job , and he said , he quit my job , because I made him feel safe and loved that he did n't have to show himself in Wall more and more , and he just wanted to go away from this city and move to a little town in New England where he could start his life with me .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York and my dream job , but I thought you had to sacrifice your partner , so I agreed and I took a break , Conor and I left Manhattan .
I did n't think that I had plugged into a crazy love , that I was taking the first step into a psychological trap , money and bodies were carefully ordered .
The next step in this violent scenario is to put in a violent threat and see how she responds .
From here , the guns come in .
When we moved to New England -- you know , where Conor was based on how to feel safe -- he bought three guns .
He maintained a plant in the closure of our car .
A tree beneath our bedside , the third plant he s always in his wallet .
And he said that he needed these guns because of the damage he had in the past as a child .
He needed them to feel protected .
But these guns were actually a message for me , and although he had n't yet taken his arm towards me , my life was in danger of every single minute .
Conor was attacking me five days before our wedding .
It was at 7 a . m . when I was in my bedroom .
I 'm lamg on my roofs , trying to be disrupted , and I 'm depressed , Conor uses my anger as a defender to take two arms around my neck and squeeze it up so I ca n't breathe or scream , and he s using my head on a continuous wall .
Five days later , 10 bruises on my neck showed up , and I wore my mother s wedding dress , and I was married to him .
Despite what happened , I 'm still sure we 're going to live happily ever because I love him and he loves me a lot .
And he was very sorry .
He was really stressed out of the wedding and was married to me .
It was an individual incidence , and he would never hurt me again .
It happened twice a week in the honey moon .
For the first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I was lost , and he hit the side of my head so hard that my head was constantly beating the glass of the car .
A few days later , when he was driving home after the honeymoon , he was tired of his car , and he threw all the Big Mac food into my face .
Conor then went on to beat me one to two times a week for two months and half a year from marriage .
I was wrong to think that I was the only case and I was alone in this .
A third of American women went through domestic violence or Arab violence in some phase of their lives and reported CDC that 15 million children were abused every year , 15 million children .
So I was in a really good company .
Back to my question : Why am I here ?
And the answer is very easy .
I do n't know if he s violent me .
He even shocked me up on my head , threw me down on the floor , threatened to kill my dogs , took the keys out of the car while I was driving into the highway and knocked grinds cafe on my head when I was dressing for the interview , I never once thought of myself as an admitted wife .
Instead , I 'm a strong woman in love with a man who has a problem , and I 'm the only person on the planet who can help Conor face his ugly .
The other question people ask is , why did n't she leave ?
Why did n't I walk ? I could go away at any time .
For me , that s the most depressing and painful question , because we as victims know something that you usually do n't know : it s a terrible danger to leave a violence like that .
Because the last step in the domestic violence was to kill her .
More than 70 percent of all domestic violence happened after the victim ended the relationship , after she left , because then the violence was gone .
But the other consequence as being watched for a long time , even after the abuse of married marriage ' the advantage of the financial resources ' and the movement of the whole family plan to terrify the victim and her children , these children are often constrained by the judgment of the court not being overlooked with the men who beat their mothers .
And we continue to ask , why did n't she leave ?
I was able to move away , because a crude brittle brush finally melted my forgive .
I realized that the man I loved would kill me if I left him .
So I broke the silence .
I tell people , the police , the neighbors , my friends and family , who are completely foreign , and I 'm here today because you 're helping me .
We have the stereotypical notion of victim as being terrifying headlines , women who destroy themselves , good things that are damaged .
The question is , Who is she here ?
That s the argument of some people , and that s her mistake as if the victim had chosen to love the man with intent to destroy us .
But since Crazy Love , I 've heard hundreds of stories from men and women who 've also left , who 've learned a worthless life lesson but have happened , and people who have rebuilt life -- happiness , joy -- like the staff , the wives , the mothers , the lives are totally non-violence , like me .
Because the fact that I 'm a typical family violence has ended up being a typical survivor of domestic violence .
I married with a nice and kind man , and we had three children together .
I have the Black Lab dog and I have the Minivan .
What I 'd never had half , ever been a fork gun in my head because someone said he loved me .
Now , you might be thinking , Oh , this is great , or , Oh , how stupid she was , but all this time , I was really talking about you .
I 'm sure those of you who are listening to me right now are people who are being abused or people who are being abused as a child or people who are being abused to themselves .
The persecution can affect your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
I could end my crazy story by destroying silence .
I 'm exploding the silence today .
This is how I help other victims , and this is my last request .
Let s tell you what you hear here .
The abuse was just frightening in silence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by screaming in there a beam of light .
We have victims who need everybody .
We need you to understand the secrets of family violence .
soi roi , the light abuse of today by talking about it with your kids , your friends , your family .
Resiting their lives as happy , lovely people for the open future .
Knowing the early signs of violence and lies of conscience , reducing it down , showing the victim to be safe .
Together we can make our beds discuss and our families feel peaceful and safe .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are about 10 , 000 species of birds in the world right now .
Foom is one of the most endangered birds .
When you see a grabbing like this , the first thing that happens in your mind is , these are truly disgusting , ugly creatures , engaging and just targeting your meat , reacting to your politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change the feelings that you give to these birds , because they need our compassion . They 're really needed .
Let me tell you why .
First of all , why are they so bad ?
When Charles Darwin crossed the Pacific in 1832 from the Beagle , he saw the Turkey chicks , and he said , These birds are disgusting to the red head created to cheat in the rocks .
You ca n't get worse than that , and those are words Charles Darwin .
You know , he changed his opinion when he came back , Let me tell you why .
They were also connected to Disne-- personalized into stupid , stupid , stupid characters .
More recently , if you 're watching the news in Kenya -- these are the characteristics that are associated with the Keya landscape , but I want to resist that .
I want to resist because you know what ?
Because the police do n't keep the environment clean .
The landscape does n't stop the spread of disease .
They can hardly regime a husband .
They were far from extinction .
And , what I like the most is , the proximity looks a lot more .
There are two types of meditators on the planet .
The World Trade Organization is found mainly in the U . S . , like condor and caracaras after that , the World Office , where there are 16 species . Of these 16 species , there are 11 species that face a high risk of extinction .
So , why is that important ? First of all , they provide critical ecological services . They clean up .
They 're actually natural garbage guys .
They clean up the dead bodies to the bone .
They help kill bacteria . They help to absorb coal that was widespread and cause tremendous losses to cattle and to cause other species of animal species .
The last studies have shown that in areas where there s no dead caribou need three to four times more time to decompose , and the great impact from this is the spread of disease .
Foom also has a great history of their importance .
They 've been linked to ancient Egyptians .
Nekhbet is a symbol of the protector and the love of the mother , and with the snake , they symbolize the companion between the Indian and the Soviet Union .
In the Hindu mythology , Jatayu is a protocol , and he risked the life to save the Sita from the first 10 Ravana .
In the Tibet culture , they did a very important Christmas . In places like Tibet , there was no place to bury dead people , or there was no wood to meditate them , so the meditators provided a natural waste system .
So what s the edge ?
We have eight species of prototypes that appear in Kenya , where there are six species that are threatened with the risk of extinction .
The reason is that they 're poison , they 're poisoned is because there s this conflict between people and the wild world . The community is using this toxic material to get into predatory animals , but instead , the prosecutors are the victims of this .
In South Asia , countries like India and Pakistan , four species of meditators are listed on a list of highly dangerous risks , which means that they 're less than 10 or 15 years to reach an extinction level , and the reason that s because they 're turned into a prey because it has to be treated with reduction like Diclofenac .
It s been banned in the veterinary industry in India , and they 've shown that .
Because there s no money , there s a huge spread of wild dogs in the area of animal waste , and when you have wild dogs , you have a huge , day-time bomb on paranoid disease , which has grown a lot in India .
Kenya will have the largest wind field in Africa with 353 engines installed in Lake Turkana .
I 'm not against wind power , but we need to work with government , because the wind engine makes the bird look like this . They cut it in half .
They 're called the chimpanzee .
In West Africa there s a terrible trade for trade for magic markets and spell .
So what did we do ? We 're working on these birds . We 're putting the receiver on them .
We 're trying to identify their basic ecology , and track where they come .
We can see them moving to a lot of different countries , so if you focus on the issues on the scale , it wo n't help you .
We need to work with government on a local level .
We 're working with local communities .
We 're talking to them about respecting the chicks that are necessary for embracing these wonderful creatures and the benefits that they bring .
How do you help ? You can become a dynamic person , create a voice . You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these misunderstood creatures . Love a little bit of time to pass on . Loan communicates .
When you walk out of this room , you get information about the grabbing birds , but tell your family , your kids , your neighbor about the edge .
They were so elegant . Charles Darwin said , You changed the opinion because he saw them flying in an alphabet like no force in the sky .
Kenya , this world , it would be much poorer if there were no great animals .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 years old , I remember one morning I woke up one morning when I heard the celebration in my house .
My father was hearing the BBC news on his little gray radio .
He blows up a big smile , which is very unusual because news often makes him sad .
And he said , The Taliban have gone !
Now I did n't understand that well , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
Now you can actually go to school . He said .
One morning I could n't forget .
A real school .
You know , the Taliban came into Afghanistan since I was six years old and stopped the girls from going to school .
For the next five years , I was dressed as a boy to go with my sister to a secret school because my sister was forbidden from my house alone .
It s the only way we can go to school .
Every day , we go a different path to no one questioned about our destination .
We 're hidden books in the market , so people will think we just go shopping .
That school in a house , more than 100 of our kids were wrapped in a small living room .
Pretty warm in winter , but summer is extremely hot .
We all know that we 're risking our lives as teachers , our students and our parents .
At some point , the school suddenly closed for about a week because the Taliban were suspicious .
We 're always wondering what they know about us .
Are we being watched ?
Do they know where we are ?
We were terrified , but nevertheless , we still wanted to go to school .
I 'm very fortunate to be raised in a very respectful family of learning and girls that are respected .
My grandfather was a very compliant at the time .
A man was completely raped out of a distant province in Afghanistan , and he insisted that my daughter , my mother , had come to school , and so he had given up .
But my mother had my education as a teacher .
Here she is .
She retired two years ago to use our house to provide school for girls and women in her neighborhood .
And this is my father , who was the first person in his family , was educated .
No doubt that his children will be educated , including his daughters , regardless of the Taliban , and regardless of the dangers .
For him , children do n't learn to be a greater risk .
In the Taliban years , I remember that there were times when I was very angry about our lives and was always frightened and could n't see the future .
I would love to let go of school , but my father , he would say , Listen to girls , you can lose everything you have in your life .
Your money can be stole . You can be forced to leave the house during the war time .
But one thing that will forever remain with you is this one , and if we 're forced to sell blood to pay for obesity , we 'll do that .
So you want to go on ?
I 'm 22 today .
I was raised in a country that was destroyed by the decade of war .
Less than six percent of my old women were in high school , and if my family was n't committed to my education , I was also one of them .
But still , I 'm proud to stand here as a graduate student at the Middlebury College .
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was abandoned by my family because he dared to let his daughter go to school , was one of the first people to celebrate me .
He s not just about my higher degree gifts , he s about me being the first woman , and I 'm the first woman to be able to transport him on the streets of Kabul .
My family believed me .
I had a big dream , but my family wished for me to be bigger .
So I 'm a global ambassador for 10x10 , and this is a global movement to educate women .
So I helped establish SOLA , the first school , and it must be only for girls in Afghanistan , a country that was still dangerous for girls to go to school .
I was very excited to see my students coming to my school with the hopes to get this opportunity .
And I saw their parents and their fathers like mine , support them , regardless and even when I was having a lot of difficulty .
Like Ahmed . It was n't his real name , and I could n't tell his face , but Ahmed was the father of my student .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way to SOLA from their village , and they were literally just killed because of a bomb inside the street for just a few minutes .
When he first came home , the phone reng , a voice that threatened him if he kept moving his daughter to school , they would try it again .
And he said , If you want to kill me , but I 'm not going to destroy my daughter s future because of those back-line and back-line ideas .
I now notice about Afghanistan , and this is what s often overlooked in the West , is behind most people who succeed , we are a father who embraced their girl s value and who saw their girl s success as their own success .
This is not the mother who does n't matter in our success .
In fact , they were the first and they were persuasive to a bright future of their daughters , but in social situations like Afghanistan , we need the support of the men .
Under the Taliban , girls went to school hundreds of people remember , this is illegal .
But today , more than three million women are in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks very different from the U . S .
I found that Americans see weakness , fragility in change .
I was afraid that all of those changes would n't be longer after the U . S . military would go away .
But when I returned to Afghanistan , when I saw my students in my school and my parents supported them , encouraged them , I saw a promising future and a long-lasting future .
For me , Afghanistan is a country of hope , unlimited capacity , and every day the SOLA reminds me of that .
Like me , they have a big dream .
Thank you .
Hello . This is my cellphone .
A mobile phone can change your life , and a phone can give you your freedom .
With a mobile phone , you can record human rights invasion in Syria .
With a mobile phone , you can post a message on Tweeter and start joining a government protester in Egypt .
And with a telephone you can record a song , post it to SoundCloud and become famous .
All of that could be with your mobile phone .
I was a child of 1984 , and I lived in Berlin City .
Let s go back to that time in the city .
You can see here how thousands of people stand up and stand up for change .
It was the fall in 1989 , and imagine the people who came up and the protests demanded that there was a mobile phone in the pocket .
Who in this room has a mobile phone ?
Let s put it up .
Raise your phone , raise your phone !
Raise it up . A telephone Android , Blackberry , wow .
A lot . Today , most of us have a mobile phone .
But today I 'm going to talk about myself and my telephone , and how it has changed my life .
I 'm going to talk about that .
There s about 3530 blocks of information .
The purely information .
But why is that information here ?
The reason is because in the summer of 2006 , the European Commission proposed a formal indicator .
It s called the data archive .
This shows that every telecommunications company in Europe , every Internet service provider across the European territory , has to store vast amounts of information about the users .
Who s the calling ? Who sent somebody an email ?
Who sent mobile messages ?
And if you use mobile phones , this is where the problem exists .
All this information is stored at least six months , until two years by the house you 're using or the Internet service provider .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , We do n't want that .
They said , we do n't want this kind of personal information archive .
We want to have autonomy in the digital age , and we do n't want that telecommunications companies and Internet service providers store all of their information .
They 're lawyers , journalists and all domestic fathers , all say , We do n't want to .
And you can see here , like 10 , 000 people on the streets of Berlin and the corals of Freedom , are not afraid .
And some people even said , it s like Stasi 2 . 0 .
Stasi is the police force that works in Eastern Germany .
I 've also wondered , does it actually work ?
Can they record our entire information ?
Every time we use our mobile phones ?
So I asked my house to use , Deutsche Telekom , the German telecommunications provider at the time , and I asked them , please , send me the whole information they had stored .
I asked them to send me one more time , and I kept asking them , but what I got was a non-obvious answer . Blah blah blah blah blah .
But then I said , I want to get this information , because they 're storing my life .
And I decided to send the case to the court , because I wanted this information .
But Deutsche Telekom said , no , we 're not going to give you this information .
And finally , I had a deal with them .
I 'm going to cancels , and they 're going to give me the information that I 'm asking .
Because at the time , the Federal Constitution court was regulating that the European Commission had not worked in the German constitutional system .
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD inside .
And on the CD , what I needed was recorded on it .
3530 blocks of information .
I first looked at it , and I said , OK . It s a big data file . Good .
But then I realized , this is my whole life .
This is my six months of life , documenting all in this data .
And then I wondered a little bit , what should I do with it ?
Because I can see where I went , where I was sleeping every night , what I did .
But then I said , I want to open this information .
I want it to be known by the public .
Because I want to show you what data protection really is .
So for Zeit Online and Open Data City , I did the same thing .
These are visual images of life for six months that have been recorded .
You can zoom in or shrink it up , you can either reverse or faster in the front .
You can see my step by step .
You may even know how I went to Frankfurt with a train to Cologne , and the frequency I called the communication between those two places .
They can all be with this information .
I had a little scary .
But that information was n't just about me .
It s about all of us .
First of all , it s just like this , I call my wife , and she calls me , and we talk to each other three times .
And then some friends call me , they call each other .
A little while later you call you , and you call you , and you get this vast network of communication .
But you can see how we communicate with each other , they call each other when , when they go to sleep .
You can see it all .
You can see the most important parts , like the leaders in a group .
If you have access to this information , you can see the activity of the community , the society .
If you have access to this information , you can control the whole society .
This is a map of design for countries like China or Iran .
This is a drawing of how to survey society because you know who s talking to somebody who s sent emails , all of that could be if you had access to this information .
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe , until two years .
As I said when I started , imagine if all of these guys on the streets of Berlin in 1989 had a mobile phone in the pocket .
Maybe Stasi will know who s been involved in this demonstration , and if Stasi knows who s the leader behind it , maybe it will never happen .
The collapse of the Berlin wall may not exist .
And if so , maybe the collapse of the iron in the Cold War would n't exist .
Because today , functional agencies and companies want to capture the information they have as much as they can , online and online .
They want to be able to track our lives , and so they want to capture this information at all times .
Autonomy and living in a digital age is not conflict .
What you should do is fight for your freedom today .
And you have to fight for it every day .
Then , when you go home , let s tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value , and that s not obsolete .
When you go home , tell your representatives that by companies and institutions can capture specific information , even though they do n't necessarily have to do that .
And if you do n't trust me , ask the networks to provide the information they 've stored back to you .
So , in the future , every time you use your telephone , let it remind you that you have to fight for your personal autonomy in this digital age .
Thank you .
Photography is my passion ever since I 'm big enough to hold a camera , but today I 'd like to share with you 15 pictures that I 'm most excited about , and I have n't taken any of them .
There s no art director , there s no models , there s no photographs , there s not even interested in light .
In fact , most of them were taken by accidental tourists who happened to pass .
The story began when I went to New York City to participate in a speech and my wife took a picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday , and we stood on the corner of 57 and 5 .
We happened to go back to New York just one year later , so we decided to take another one .
You can see where the story is coming .
When you 're coming up to my daughter s third birthday , my wife said , Why do n't you take Sabrina to New York , do a trip that has only fathers and girls , and then keep ritualizing ?
Since then we started with guerrillas on the street .
You know , the impact of giving cameras to a completely foreign person all over the world is remarkable .
Nobody rejected , and fortunately no one ran with our camera .
We did n't know how that trip was going to change our lives .
It became sacred to us .
This was taken a few weeks after 9 / 11 , and I tried to explain what happened that day in ways that a five-year-old boy could understand .
These pictures are not just the representative of a moment , or a particular trip .
They are the way we stop time for a week of October , thinking about our time and how we change each year , not just physically , but in every way .
Because even though we took the same picture , our views changed , my daughter had new marks , and I saw life through her eyes , the way she looked and interact with everything .
The time we were focusing on each other is something that we 've been honoring and expecting for the year .
Recently , on a trip , we were walking , and my daughter suddenly ended up in the middle of the road , and she pointed to the red roof of the scandal store that she loved when she was a kid on our previous trips .
She described to me how she felt at the age of five , when she was in the right position .
It says that he remembers his heart as it first came out of his chest cage when he first saw that shop nine years ago .
And now what it sees in New York is universities , because it decided to go to New York .
And I realized that one of the most important things that we 've created is memory .
So I want to share the idea that the active role of creating memories .
I do n't know about you , but out of these 15 pictures , I do n't appear much in the family pictures .
I 'm always a photographer .
So today I want to encourage everybody to be in the picture , and do n't talk to someone else , and say , Can you take a picture of us ?
Thank you .
I 've never forgotten my grandmother s words -- she died in a forgiveness : Hey , let s fight Gaddafi . Let s fight him .
But never make it a form of the Gaddafi revolution .
Almost two years have been passed since the Khmer Rouge in Libya , which has been empowered by generous waves from the means of Tunisia and Egypt .
I joined the forces in and out of Libya to call for the day of outrage and to start an initiative against the Gaddafi regime .
And that s a great revolution .
The young women on the front lines demanded overthrowing government , raise up the expressions of freedom , dignity , social justice .
They 've shown a mirror of the profoundly confronted the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi .
They showed a colony that spreads from east to west and extends to the south .
After all , after six months of terrible war with the total casualties of 50 , 000 people we managed to release our country and we flipped the name of God .
However , Gaddafi left a burden , a legacy of authoritarian , corrupt and divisive germs .
For four decades , Gaddafi s brutality has destroyed infrastructure and culture and ethical foundations of Libya society .
The challenge of destruction and the challenges , as well as how many other women , are rebuilding Libya s civil society , calls for the whole thing and the transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
Almost 200 organizations were set up in Benghazi during that time and just after Gaddafi fell -- almost 300 in Tripoli .
After 33 years of forgiveness , I returned to Libya , with a unique enthusiasm , I started to organize training classes that enhance power , to grow people in leadership skills .
And in the same group of women , I co-founded the Libya Settlement for Peace , a movement of women , leaders from every different part of society , to lobby for social empowerment for women and to campaign for our rights to be equal to building democracy and peace .
I was in a very difficult position of election money , an increasingly polarized environment , an environment that was shaped by a very politically selfish politics and eliminated .
I led an initiative from the Libya Segment for Peace to lobby for a more comprehensive election law that would bring to all the citizens , no matter how they came from , right to vote and vote , and most importantly , set the rules for the political parties to compensate male and female candidates and women along and across their list to create a tag list .
And finally , our initiatives had been accepted and succeeded .
Women won 17 . 5 percent in the United States Congress in the first election in the last 52 years .
However , a little bit by bit , the excitement from the elections and the general revolution just disappears -- once we woke up with the news about violence .
We woke up one day with the news about the complexities of the old Sufi temple and the larvae of the Sufi .
The other day we woke up with the news of the American ambassador and attacked into the embassy .
Another day we woke up with the news of the assassination of military officers .
And every day , we wake up with the rule of military power and their continuous infringement about human rights and incarceration and disrespectability in their laws .
Our society , which was founded by revolutionaries , became more polarized and left with ideals , principles of freedom , dignity , social equality that we pursued at the beginning .
Understanding , elimination and revenge became the symbol of the era of meaning .
I 'm here not intentionally to inspire you with the success story of creating a lock list and elections .
I 'm here to admit that we -- the whole country made the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
We did n't prioritize citizenship .
Because the elections do n't bring peace , stability or security to Libya .
Is it a locker list and an intersection of male and female candidate give peace and reconciliation to the country ?
No , no .
So what did it ultimately help ?
Why do we continue to be a society of polarization and dominance by the selfish politics of dominance and elimination , by both men and women ?
Maybe the lack is not just about women s rights but about women s feminism , compassion , tolerance , and inclusiveness .
Our society needs a national conversation and a more constructive consensus than it needs elections that , just increases polarization and divide .
Our society needs physical representations from women rather than numbers and quantities of female representation .
We need to stop acting like these evangelical ambassadors , stop advocating days .
We need to start acting like the ambassadors of compassion and tolerance .
We need to develop a feminine conversation that not only honor but actually does tolerance instead of hatred , cooperative rather than competition , which is comprised instead of eliminating .
These are the ideas that a country has been devastating as Libya is absolutely needed to be peaceful .
Because peace as a metallurgy , it needs compliance , interlocated between male and female perspectives .
That s the real key .
And we need to set up the alive factor before we do the political thing .
In one verse in the Koran Salam -- peace -- is God s word that s generous , raheem .
And then , from raheem , known in the traditions of Abraham , the same root as the Arabic language is rahem -- the death -- is for women -- the mother is wrapped with humanity where men and women , from every tribe , every tribe , born .
And because the utero is completely wrapped up in it , the sacred matrix of love that feeds that entire life .
So we 're taught that our tolerance contains all sorts of things .
So we 're taught that our tolerance wins the outrage .
May each of us be supported by compassion .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I went through something that was a little bit like Alice in Wonderland .
Penn State School asked me , a teacher who was teaching a course to communicate with engineering students .
I was terrified .
It s really scary . It s those big students , those big books and those strange words .
But when the discussions opened , I had an experience that Alice also went through when she went down to the rabbit and discovered that the door would lead to a new world .
That s just what I felt when I was talking to my students , and I was amazed at their ideas , and I wanted others to be experiencing this proprietary place .
I believe the key to the world is the ability to communicate .
We really need to communicate with the scientists and engineers to change the world .
Scientists and engineers are the people who are dealing with the biggest challenges , from energy to environment and health , and there s more , If we do n't know and do n't understand that , it s not going to be done , and I believe our responsibility , the people who are not specialized , is to interact with them .
But effective exchange can not happen if scientists and engineers do n't invise us into their place .
Scientists and engineers , eight stories with us .
I 'd like to share some secrets to do that so that we could find your science fascinating , sexy is also very attractive , hot .
The first is : What ?
Why does science relate to us ?
Not only do you say you study bone tissue , but let s say you study bone tissue , it s like the net that makes our bones because you need to know about bone dilusion and treatment .
When you describe science , be careful with words .
Well , the term stops us from understanding your ideas .
Surely , spatial and temporal , but why not use space and time .
Making ideas easy to understand is not to lower them .
Instead , as Anh-lemonade said , make things as simple as possible , but do n't be simpler .
Clearly you can talk about scientific problems without interrupting ideas .
So it s about talking about examples , telling stories , constantly , These are ways of appealing and getting us excited about what you say .
And when it comes to me , do n't use the headlines .
Have you ever wondered why they 're calling them the headline ?
What about the brick of the name ? The cutting-edge is erasing , killing , killing , and they 'll kill your talk too .
A slide like this , not only are boring , but it s so much dependent on the linguistic areas of the brain , that make us sick .
Instead , this slide , for example , of Genevieve Brown , actually understands more . It shows that the special structure of bone tissue is so powerful that it actually inspires the original design of the Op-phen Tower .
And the trick here is to use simple and readable sentences that they can rely on if they do n't keep up , and then use images to drag us into the senses to help us much deeper understand what s shown .
I think these are just a few secrets that help us open that door and see the ancestry of science and technology .
The engineers I worked with had to know how to shut things down , so I 'd like to summarize with a equation .
Take science except for the first brick of the line and the jargon and the jargon and the term , which is to share the right explanations for the audience , and then to humanize the passion that you 're doing for what you 're doing , then the results are going to be The Great interaction brings the complete understanding of the whole thing .
And so , scientists and engineers , when you solve this equation , at all expenses , let s talk about eight things for me .
Thank you .
Hello . I 'm Cameron Russell , and in the last short time , I 'm a model .
Actually , in 10 years .
And I feel that there s an uncomfortable pressure in the room right now because I should n't wear this dress .
Fortunately , I have a different suit .
This is the first time someone on the TED stage , so I think you 're very lucky to see this .
If some women were so terrified when I showed up , you did n't have to tell me what I am right now , but then I 'll know through Twitter .
I realized that I was very lucky to be able to change what you think of me in 10 seconds .
Not everybody has the opportunity to do this .
These high heels are very uncomfortable , and I 'm not going to bring them .
The worst part is to grab this long t-shirt through my head because you smile me , so do n't do anything when it s on my head .
Okay .
Why do I do that ?
It s weird .
In fact , it s not that strange as this picture .
It s a powerful image , but it s also a fake .
I just changed what you thought of me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I actually have n't had a boyfriend in my life .
I was so uncomfortable at the time , and photographer told me to use his back and put my hands on his hair .
And of course , except for surgery , or the fake sunshine that I had two days ago to photograph , there are very few things that we can do to change our appearance , and our appearance , even though it s fake and unchanged , it has a huge impact on our lives .
So today , to me , it s not all about being true .
And I 'm standing on this stage because I 'm a model .
I 'm standing on this stage because I 'm beautiful , white woman , and in the model industry , we call it a sexy girl .
And I 'm going to answer the questions that people have always asked me , but with the truth .
The first is , how do I become a model ?
And I always say , Oh , I 'm discovered , but it does n't make any sense .
I actually became a model because I won the genetic lottery , and I 'm a inherited asset , and you may be wondering what inheritance is .
In the last decade , we 've defined beauty , not only as healthy and young , and the symmetry that we 've been programmed biotically to aspire , but as height , pieces of pieces and women , and white .
This is the legacy that was built for me and that s the legacy that I made for money because of it .
I know some of you are skeptical of it , and some of you may be dressed like , Wait a minute . Naomi . Tyra . Joan Smalls . Liu Wen .
I 'd like to praise your model . It s very impressive .
But unfortunately I have to tell you in 2007 , a Ph . D . student at the University of New York wrote a statistic of all the specimens on the stage , and in 67 people that were employing only 27 people , less than four percent , is not white .
The next question that people have always asked me is : Can you become a model when you grow up ?
And my first answer is : You do n't know , you do n't have a recruitment .
The next answer I really want to say to the girls is , Why ?
You know what ? You can become anyone .
You can become the president of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a poet of cardiovascular surgery , will be great , right , because you will be the first one to do it .
If , after a very interesting list , they said , No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , then I 'll say , Master your boss .
Because you do n't have any power , you can be the editor of Vogue magazine in the U . S . or the CEO of H & M , or Steven Meisel in the future .
I say I want to be the model when I 'm growing up like I want to win the lottery ticket when I 'm growing up .
It s out of your control , and it s great , but it s not a career path .
I 'm going to show you -- with 10 years of my experience , I 'm accumulating as a model , because it s not like a cardiac surgeon , so it just takes a short time .
If photography was standing here and the light was there , like an interactive interface , and when the client said , Cameron , we want the picture that you 're walking , so this leg was about to be beautiful and long , this hand would hit back , and it was about three quarters away , and you just go back and forth , you just do that , and then you just look behind , imagine that s your friends , 300 , 500 times .
It s like this .
And hopefully it s less weird than the picture in the middle .
I do n't know what happened in the meantime .
Sadly after you 're finished , you write résumé and you 've done something , you ca n't say anything else , because if you say you want to be President of the United States , but your résumé says , You 're going to see you with other eyes .
The next question that people are always asking me is : Is all the images repaired ?
That s true , almost all the images are edited , but that s just a small element of what s going on .
This is one of the first images I ever took , which was the first time I took a bathtub , and I did n't even have a menstrual cycle .
I know that we 're going into personal things , but I was a little girl then .
This is my grandmother s look , just a few months ago .
This is me in the same day when the photo was taken .
My friend went with me .
This is me at a dinner party just a few days before photographing for French Vogue .
This is me with a soccer team in the V magazine .
And this is me right now .
I hope you can see -- these pictures are not my image .
These are images being created , and it was created by a group of experts , hair makers , jewelry experts , photographers , and innovators and all their assistants , seamlessly money produced , and post-production , and they created this . That s not me .
The next question that I 've been asked is : What are you for free ?
I have a lot of high heels that I never had , in the last time , exception , but the free stuff that I got was in my real life , and that s something that we do n't want to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and I went to the store , and I forgot to bring money and they gave me a free dress .
When I was a teenager , I was in a car with a friend who was a very scary driver , and she passed the red light , and we were arrested , and all I did was say , Sorry the police , and we could go on .
I get these free things because of my appearance , not because I 'm who and who are willing to spend a lot of money on their appearance rather than who they are .
I lived in New York , and last year , in 140 , 000 teenagers were arrested and under control , 86 percent were black and Hispanic , mostly young teenagers .
In New York , there are only 177 , 000 black and Latino people , so for them the question is , Am I arrested ?
It s : How many times will I be arrested and when ?
When I was preparing for this talk , I found that 53 percent of those 13-year-olds in the U . S . did n't like their bodies , and that number was up to 78 percent when they were 17 years old .
The last question that people ask me was , How does it feel to be a model ?
I think what they want to hear is , If you 're a little bit thinner , and your hair is a little bit more happy and happy .
And when we were in the back of the chicken , we came up with an answer like this .
It s wonderful to travel , and to work with creative , inspiring and passionate people .
And that s true , but that s only half of it , because what we never said before in front of the lens , which I never said before in front of the lens , is : I 'm insecure .
I 'm disappointed because I have to think about my image every day .
And you ever ask yourself , If your thigher and your hair is more relaxed , would you be happier ?
You just meet a group of people , because they have the best legs , the slightest hair and the best suit , and they can be the most insecure women on the planet .
When I was writing this speech , I was so hard to find true balance , because on the one hand , I was so uncomfortable to come here to say , I 've got all this stuff because I 've been lucky enough to support , and I 've also been really upset with the next sentence , but it does n't make me happy .
But mostly it s hard to remove a legacy of gender and race while I 'm one of the biggest beneficiaries .
But I 'm also happy and honored to come up here , and I think it s lucky that I 've come before 10 , 20 or 30 years ago , and I 've been working with a lot of companies in my career , because then I may not tell you how I have the first job , or maybe I wo n't talk about how I have the money to charge , which seems to be that important right now .
If something is stuck in this talk , I hope it s all of us are much more comfortable acknowledging the power of images in our perception of success and failure .
Thank you .
There are many ways that people around us can help improve our lives .
We do n't touch each other , so there s a lot of intelligence that s never known , even though we share public spaces .
So over the last few years , I 've been trying to share more ways with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like paperwork , pockey and pollen .
And these projects came from the questions that I had , like , how much money did my neighborhood pay for their apartments ?
How do we borrow and borrow more stuff without knocking each other s door at a bad time ?
How do we share more of our memories of abandoned buildings , and much better knowledge about our landscapes ?
And how do we share more of our hopes for factories that are empty , so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
Now , I live in New Orleans , and I 'm in love with New Orleans .
My spirit has always been cooled by giant , alive trees , shadows on the beloved , the drunks and the dreamers for hundreds of years , and I believe in the city that always provides music .
I feel like every time , New Orleans had a whole march .
Cities have some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has the greatest number of discarded value in the U . S .
I live near this house , and I think how I can make it a better place for my neighborhood , and I also think about something that can change my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost a very loved one .
Her name was Joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was unpredictable and unexpected .
And I 've been thinking about death a lot , and this makes me feel so deeply grateful for the time that I 've had , and has brought clarity to what it means to my life now .
But I 'm fighting to maintain this view in my everyday life .
I feel like it s really easy to capture day after day , and forget what really matters to you .
So with the help of new and new friends , I turned on one side of this abandoned building into a giant piece of pollen and made it with a film -- before I die , I want . . so that anyone who passes through it can pick up a piece of pollen , reflects their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
I do n't know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day , the wall was completely closed , and it kept growing .
And I want to share a couple of things about what people write on that wall .
Before I die , I want to try to steal .
Before I die , I want to be on the International Day line .
Before I die , I want to sing for millions of people .
Before I die , I want to grow a tree .
Before I die , I want to live outside the permission .
Before I die , I want to hold her again .
Before I die , I want to be someone s veteran .
Before I die , I want to be absolutely myself .
So this abandoned space has become an artificial space , and people s hopes and dreams make me laugh , tears tears , and they comfort me for my difficult times .
It s about knowing that you 're not alone .
It s about understanding the people around us in new and brilliant ways .
It s about creating a space for reflection and contemplating , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow up and change .
So I did this project last year , and I started getting hundreds of letters from people who wanted to make a wall in their community , so the central communities and I did a tool , and now the walls that are being done in all over the world , including Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , Austrian henti-ti-na and more .
Together , we 've shown how powerful our public spaces are if we 're given the opportunity to speak and share more with one another .
The two most important things we have are time and relationship with others .
In an age of increasing diffusion , this is even more important than ever before to find a way to sustain our perspective and remember that life is short and soft .
Death is something we 're often not encouraged to talk about or even think about , but I 've been realizing that preparing death is one of the most powerful things you can do .
Think about death clears your life .
Our shared spaces can be better than reflected on what happens to us as individuals and as communities , and in many ways to share hope , fear and stories , people around us can not only help us do better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , I did the mathematics and this is an unusual problem for anyone who does the math , which is that we 're like managers .
Nobody knows what we do .
So today I 'm going to try and explain to you what I do .
Well , dance is one of the activities that people do .
We love the masters of the Ballet and the Raptop Force you 'll see .
Three hammers require a special degree of expertise and high-tech level and possibly the right level of this class that has to do with genetics .
Sadly , neurological disorders like Parkinson s disease are increasingly destructing this particular possibility , like what s happening to my friend Jan Stripling , who , for a while , once , had a great ballet artist .
Over the last few years , there has been tremendous progress in treatment .
However , 6 . 3 million people worldwide suffer , and they have to live in such a state of debilitating , shaking , intractable hardware and different symptoms with this disease , and what we need is tools to identify the disease before we get too late .
We need to measure progress in a very objective way , and finally , the only way we know when we actually have a cure , is when we have a proper way of answering certainty .
But what s so frustrating is that for Parkinson s and other movement disorders , they have no biological footprint , so there s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best thing we have is this neurological test .
You need to go to the hospital to do that . It s very expensive , which means this is outside of clinical trials , and it s never been done .
But what if the patient could do this test at home ?
It s going to be really free to go to the clinic , and if the patient is able to do the experiment itself , what ?
It took time for the gold of the staff .
It s about 300 dollars . It s just to do this test at the Neuroscientist clinic .
So what I 'd like to propose to you is a non-traditional way through which we can achieve this , because , as you can see , at least in some ways , we 're all masters like Jan Stripling my friend .
Here we have a film of the bars that are vibrating .
This kind of manager is healthy and someone is saying , and we can see ourselves as a ballet dancer , because we have to coordinate all the pronunciation agencies to make sounds , and we actually have genes to take over that . For example , FoxP2 .
Like three goats it needs to be trained .
I mean , how long it took a kid to say .
From the sound , we can actually track where the sound is vibrating , when the spending is affected by Parkinson s , the audio agencies are also left .
So in the lower graph , you can see an example of the extraordinary vibrations of the managers ' strings .
We see the same symptoms .
We see tremor , debilitating and hardware .
A voice becomes more depressed and more wind than it is after a while , and that s one of the examples of it .
These sound effects can be really hard to detect , in some cases , but for any digital risk , and use standard speech analysis to match the latest , very innovative machine knowledge , we can now quantify exactly where someone lies in this continuous relationship between health and disease just by using voice signals .
So how do the trials based on this voice compare to the clinical trial ? They both do n't invade each other .
The experiment of neuroscience is not intrusive . They all use existing infrastructure .
You do n't have to design a whole new hospital system to do this experiment .
And they 're both accurate . But one more thing , the experiment is based on voice that does n't have expertise .
That means it can be done on its own .
The rapid pace , it takes about 30 seconds as much .
Total costs are low , and we all know what happens .
When something becomes extremely cheap , it will be widely available .
So these are some of the great goals that I think we can do now .
We can reduce the need for the patient .
It does n't have to go to the clinic to check it out .
We can actually do high-frequency observation observations to get targeted data .
We were able to recruit massively multiplication at a low cost to do clinical trials , and the evaluation on a population is possible for the first time .
We had the opportunity to start searching for the original biomarker of the disease before it was too late .
So in order to do the first step towards this , we 're showing the Parkinson s voice .
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe , we targeted audio recording to a vast global amount of data to gather enough data and start entering four targets .
We have local people who have access to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Anybody who s healthy or has Parkinson s disease can be called low-cost , and leave a record , a few cents per time , and I 'm really pleased to announce that we have six percent of the target in eight hours .
Thank you .
Tom Rielly : So Max , by taking all the models for 10 , 000 people , can you tell who s healthy and who s not ?
What are you going to conclude from these models ?
Max Little : Yeah . So what s going to happen is , when you have to figure out whether you 're sick or not .
You see , some of you may not do that . Maybe they do n't call it .
But we 're going to take a huge amount of data collection from all these different cases , and the results are important in different cases because then we 're going to look at the elements of the coincidence , and look for actual signs of this disease .
So what is right now 86 percent ?
That s a lot more than that .
In fact , my students Thanasis , I have to praise him , because he did some amazing work , he showed that this could also be done on the mobile phone , which allows this project to be done , and the accuracy is at 99 percent .
Ninety-nine . Well , a big progress .
So that means that people will be able to -- people can call from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson s disease can call them , record their voices , and then doctors can check their progress , watch their health as they get sick .
Exactly .
Thank you very much . The Max Little Treaty people .
Thank you very much , Tom .
I lived in the southern South .
This is the southern area : wine stores , fast-food , wildlife .
So the city planners came together and they decided to change the name of southern China so that they could make sense , so they changed to Southern Los Langeles , as if that would solve the real problems that are going on in the city .
This is in Southern Los Angeles .
Fast food , fast-food , wildlife .
Just like 26 . 5 million Americans , I lived in a food desert , in Southern Los Angeles , the house of the shower serves fast food on the road and accidents and drops .
Interestingly , fast food on the street is killing more people than accidents and running away .
In Southern Los Angeles , people are dying of cutting-edge diseases .
For example , the obesity rate in my area is five times higher than Beverly Hills , which is about 16 kilometers away .
I 'm bored to see this happen .
And I wondered , how do you feel when you do n't have health food , when you leave the door , you have to see the really bad effects that the food system currently causes for where you live ?
I saw a wheelchair sold in the same way as an old car .
I see blood filters grow as much as Starbucks .
And I realized that had to end .
I realized the problem was the solution .
Food is a problem and food is a solution .
For me , it felt so frustrated that I had to drive 45 minutes just to buy an apple that did n't have to do with minus .
What I did was I planted a food forest in front of my house .
It s on a pile of what we call a walkway .
It s over 30 feet wide , it s five feet long .
The problem is , that land belongs to the city .
But you have to look at it .
So I thought , Great . I can do what I want , because that s my responsibility and I have to look at it .
And this is how I look at that land .
I was with my team , Green land . A . , we got together and we started growing food forests : fruit plants , you know , nine vegetables .
We 're a group that shares hatred , including gardeners from many different lives , from all over the city , and they 're completely voluntary , and everything we do is free .
And the garden , it s beautiful .
Then there were complaints .
The city came to visit me , and sort of gave me a success , asked me to break the garden . And then it became a building block .
And I was like , Come on , really ?
A court wash because planting trees on the ground that you do n't care about ?
And I said , Okay . Come here .
Because this time it s not .
Then the L . A . Times got a message , Steve Lopez wrote an article about it , and spoke to the board commissioner , and then one of the members of the Blue Zero sent a petition card on Change . org . And with 900 letters , we succeeded .
We had a triumph winner .
That council commissioner even called up and said that they embraced and liked what we were doing .
I mean , come on , why not ?
L . A . led the United States in the area of the wilderness that the city owned .
They own 42 kiloomet squares .
That s about 20 times the central park .
enough to grow 725 million tomato trees .
How do they disagree ?
Plant a tree gives you 1 , 000 seeds .
When the amount of green beans costs a dollar to give you the same amount of products as 75 dollars .
That s my faith , when I tell people , let s grow your own food .
Drawing your food in the same way as printing money .
I have a heritage in southern China .
I grew up there . I raised my boys there .
And I refused to do part of the reality that was created , that was created for me by others , and that I was creating my reality .
I 'm an artist .
So gardens are my art . I grew up my work .
Just like an artist , a peer for walls , I , I put points for lawns , for a walk .
I use a garden piece , the land is like a canvas , and the trees and the trees are what I put in the canvas .
You will be surprised by what the land can do if you turn it into a canvas .
You ca n't imagine how great a sunflower is , and they affect people .
So what happened ?
I saw my garden as an educational tool , a tool for the transformation of my land .
In order to change the community , you have to change the components of the soil .
We 're soil .
You 'd be surprised to see how children are affected .
The gardening is the most chemotherapy and the most challenging thing you can do , especially inside the city .
Again , you get a brown again .
I remember one time , a mother and daughter came , and it was around 10 : 30 p . m . and they were in my garden , and I went out and they were very ashamed .
I thought , oh my god , I feel so bad because they 're there , and I tell them , you know , you do n't have to do that .
This gardening is on the street for its reasons .
I 'm so embarrassed to see someone next to me and still starve . And it just reinforces the reason for me to do this . People ask me , Fin , do n't you fear that people are going to steal your food ?
And I said , Of course , I 'm not afraid they 're going to steal .
So they 're just on the road .
That s what the whole idea is .
I want them to get them , but at the same time , I want them to get their health back .
Another time I was gardening in an homelessness in downtown Los Angeles .
These are the men , they helped me democratize from the truck .
The air was fun , and they shared stories of gardening that affected them and they used to grow vegetables with her mother , and it was great to see this idea that changed them , even in a moment .
So the green land has continued to grow about 20 bits of gardens .
We had about 50 people in digging , and it was all voluntary .
If they grow their helix , they eat their helix .
If they grow tomato , they eat tomato .
But if no one showed them that , if they do n't see the effects of food on the mind and the body , they 're blindly eating anything in front of them .
I see young people who want to be working , but they get bothered by something -- I see the colorful kids and they just follow the path that s already there , and they do n't lead to it .
With gardens , I saw an opportunity that we could guide kids to burden their community , and there was a sustainable life .
And when we do that , who knows ?
Maybe we 'll produce George Washington Carver next .
But if we do n't change the components of the soil , we 'll never do that .
This is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I want to grow a whole garden where people can share food .
I want to take the tandem carries and turn it into a health cafe .
Do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about free stuff , because free is not sustainable .
What s interesting about sustainability is that you have to maintain it .
I 'm talking about jobs for people , and dragging them out of the street , and giving them joy , pride and honor to grow their own food , open the farmers ' market .
What I want to do here , we 're going to make it so sexy .
I want all of us to become green riots , gardeners , fiber gardeners .
We 're going to change the concept of arrogance .
If you 're not a gardener , you 're not a butter .
Master up with your shoe , OK ?
And let s turn it into weapons you pick .
Basically , if you want to see me , you know , if you want to see me , do n't call me if you want to sit on those seats and get involved in meetings where you talk about doing this , and that s where you talk about doing this .
If you want to see me , go out to the garden with your shoe and we 'll grow something .
Hi . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya in Southern Nairobi National Park .
Behind me is my father s cow , and behind the cow , the Nairobi National Park .
The Nairobi National Park is not widely barriered in the southern part , which means that wildlife is like horses coming out of the park freely .
And so animals eat meat like lions in the back of them , and this is what these lions do .
They kill our livestock .
This is one of the cows that was killed at night , and when I woke up in the morning I found it dead , and I felt very sad , because it was the only male cow we had .
My community , Maasai , believed that we came from heaven with all of our animals and all of our land to keep them , which is why we value them .
So I grew up with a lion hatred .
The Masai fighters who protect our communities and our livestock , are also very concerned about this .
So they killed lions .
This is one of the six lions that was killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why lions in Nairobi National Park are very few .
Every son is six to nine years old , in my community , responsible for keeping his father s own cows , and I have to do the same thing .
So I had to figure out how to fix this problem .
The first idea that I had was fire , because I thought lions were scared .
But then I realized that fire did n't really work , because it even helped lions see cows .
But I did n't give up . I kept thinking .
And my second idea is to use a compensation .
I tried to trick those lions into the thought that I was standing next to the cow .
But lions are very clever .
They arrive on their first day and they see the compensation , and then they come back , but the second day they come in and they say this is not moving , it s always there .
And then lions jump in and kill the cattle .
So one night , I took a torch around the cow , and on that day , the lions did n't come .
I discovered that lions were afraid of moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a child , I worked in my room all day , and I even opened up my new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electricity .
So I took an old car battery , an old-fashioned box . It s a little device that was found in a motorcycle , and it helped the driver figure out when they wanted to turn left or turn right . It turned around .
And I have a switch to turn off and turn on the lights .
And it s a little light bulb from a broken batteries .
And I installed everything .
As you can see , the solar cell is used to reinforce the battery , and the vaccine gives energy to the clock box . I call it the thermostat .
And the clock box makes the flash switch off .
As you can see , the lights go outside , because that s the lion coming in .
And that s how the lights shine towards lions when they arrive at night .
The lightbulbs turned off and fooled lions made them think that I was walking around the cow , but actually I was sleeping in my bed .
Thank you .
I 've been building it at home two years ago , since then , we have n't had any problems with lions .
And the neighbors hear about this idea .
One of them was this woman .
She had a lot of cattle killed , and she asked me if I could help her build electric shadows .
And I said , Yes .
So I installed light bulbs . You can see behind , they 're lions .
So far , I 've helped install seven families in my community , and they work .
Now my idea has been used all over Kenya to get rid of other predators like hyenas , newspapers , and it s also used to threaten the farms away from the people s farm .
By this invention , I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I was really excited about this .
My new environment is now beginning to help by donating and raising awareness .
I even took my friends about my community , and we installed a light bulb for families who did n't have access to it and I taught them how to build it .
A year ago , I was just a boy in the cowboy s studio for my father , and I had seen these drones flying , and I said to myself that one day , I would be sitting inside of it .
And I 'm here today .
I 've got the opportunity to come here with my first time in the TED .
My biggest dream is to become an airplane engineer and an airplane pilot as I grew up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving fathers and lions , we can live with lions without any conflict .
Ashats olto . In my language , it means thank you very much .
I do n't know how much fun it is to hear your story .
So you 've got this scholarship . Yes .
You 're doing other electricity inventions .
What s next on your list ?
Your next invention , you want to make a wire . What s the power fence ?
I know the power fence was invented , but I wanted to do my own thing .
You tried , right , and you . . . He tried it before , but you stopped because of the electric shock .
Richard Turere , you 're very different .
We 're going to ride you on the road , little cousin .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
What I 'm doing , and what I 'm doing -- my life has been shaped for seven years of work in Africa as a child .
Since 1971 to 19777 -- I look young , not -- I 've worked in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in technical projects with African countries .
I 've been working for Italian NGOs and every project we 've created in Africa that fails .
I was very depressed .
By the age of 21 , I think , Italians are good people , and we 're working well in Africa .
But instead , we killed everything that we had hit .
The first project , which inspired my first book , The light waves from Zambezi , was a project in which Italians decided to teach the Zambia to grow food .
So we southern Zambia with seeds from Italy in a beautiful valley that goes down to the Zambezi River , and we teach people the Italian tomato and the Italian tomato and the mysterious . . .
Now , of course , the indigenous people are not very interested in doing this , so we paid the public , and sometimes they went to work .
We were really surprised by the indigenous people , in the fat valley like this , did n't grow any crops .
But instead of asking them why they did n't grow anything , we basically said , Thank God we 're here .
It s time to save Zambia from hunger .
And of course , everything in Africa has gone well .
We have great tomato sauce . In Italy , a tomato is about this size . In Zambia , it s this big .
It s incredible , and we said to the Zambia people , Look , are there easy crops .
When tomato butts start to achieve , nine , and in red , just one night , about 200 codes from the river are coming up and cleaning it up .
We told the Zambia , God , the horsemen !
And people said , Well , that s why we did n't grow anything here .
So why do n't people tell us before ? Have you ever asked .
I thought there were only people in Italy that was ridicule on the African soil , but then when I looked at what Americans are doing , the Brits are doing , the French are doing , and after seeing what they 're doing , I felt a little proud of my project in Zambia .
Because , you see , at least we can also grow coding codes .
You should look at the things that are not suspicious -- you should look at the things that we 've given to Africans are not suspicious .
You want to read a book , read the Dambisa Moyo , a Zambia economist .
The book was published in 2009 .
We , the Western aid countries , which have brought to Africa , two billion U . S . Kim in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you what the money is causing .
Take a look at her book .
Reading it from a woman in Africa , the damage we 've done .
The Western people like us are imperialists , the secular people , and we have only two ways to treat each other : either aid , or protections .
Two words are originally from La Tipater , which means dad .
They have two different meanings .
Conservation , I treat anybody from other cultures as if they 're my child . I love them .
For help , I treat everybody from other cultures like my own backpack .
That s why the white people in Africa are called the bwana , the boss .
I was kind of bombed in the face of reading the book , Small but beautiful , wrote by Schumber , saying , most of all , in economic growth , if other people do n't need help , let s wear them .
So this should be the first commandment in aid .
The first commandment for aid is respect .
This morning , the organizer puts a stick on the floor , and says , Can we -- imagine a city without new colonialism ?
When I was 27 years old , I decided to just respond to people , and I created a system called Enterprise Facilitation , where you would n't start anything you 'd never motivate anyone , but become a man of mine for indigenous people who wanted to be a better person .
So you 're making -- you 're silent .
Never bring a community with ideas , you 're sitting with indigenous people .
We do n't work from offices .
We met at the cafeteria . The cafeteria .
We do n't have any infrastructure .
And what we did was we became friends of each other , and we found out what the person wanted to do .
The most important thing is aspiration .
You can give someone an idea .
If that person does n't want to do it , then what do you do ?
The aspiration of women who have for her development is the most important thing .
The desire for men to have for development is the most important thing .
And we helped them do a search for insight , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
The people who had an idea were n't quite sure they had the knowledge , but the knowledge was always there .
So , years ago , I had this idea : Why do n't we , just once , instead of going to a community , and telling people what they should do , why do n't we listen to them once ? But not in community meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There s a problem in community meetings .
The entrepreneurs never got there , and they did n't have a chance to tell you , in the community meeting , what they wanted to do with their money , the opportunity they had found .
So there s this plan to be a blind spot .
The smartest people in the community you never know because they 're not going to go to public meetings .
What we do is we work on one-to-one and to do that , you have to create a social structure that does n't exist .
You have to create a new industry .
A new profession as a family doctor for business , a family doctor for the job , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at your cafe , and helps you find resources to turn your aspirations into a way of earning a living .
I started as an experiment in Esperance , West Australia .
I was in philosophy at the time , trying to get away from the lifestyling method that came and told you what to do .
So what I did in the first year at Esperance was just on the street , and for three days , I had the first client in a car bug , called Maori , and I helped him sell fish to a restaurant in Perth , and then a fisherman came up to me and said , Can you help Maori ? Can you help me ?
And I helped these fishermen know how to work together and sell these perfect tuna not to the toy plant in Albany for 60 dollars , but we found a way to sell them to Japan to make sushi for 15 dollars a sign , and then the farmers came up and said , Hey , can you help these people . Can you help us ?
For a year , I had 27 linear projects and government people coming up to me and ask me , How do you do that ?
He did this -- and I said , I did a very difficult job .
And I piled my mouth , and I listened to them .
So the government says to me , Go ahead .
We did that in 300 communities around the world .
We helped start 40 , 000 jobs .
There s a new generation of entrepreneurs who are exhausted by isolation .
Peter Drucker , one of the greatest management advisers in history , died at the age of 96 , a few years ago .
Peter Drucker was a philosophical professor before working on business , and this is what Peter Drucker said : Planning really does n't match a society and a business economy .
Case to be a dead kiss to entrepreneurs .
So right now you 're rebuilding Jerchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Tanzania want to do with their money and their potential .
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
You have to give them security , privacy , you have to be really excited to help them , and they 're going to go , crowdsourcing .
With a 10 , 000 people , we can have about 200 clients .
Can you imagine a 400 , 000 people , intelligence and aspiration ?
What talks do you clap the best in the morning ?
Local people , people who aspire . Those are friends who have claimed to reward .
So what I 'm talking about is Business is where it comes from .
We 're at the last phase of the Industrial Revolution -- with sources of fuel and manufacturing that ca n't replicate , and suddenly we have non-sustainable systems .
The combustion engine is not sustainable .
Freon s path to storage things is unsustainable .
What we have to look at is we have to feed , treat , education , move and communicate to seven billion people in a sustainable direction .
There s no technology to do that .
What s the technology for the green revolution ? The universities ? Forgot !
Governments ? Forget !
It s going to be the nickname , and they 're doing it right now .
There was a very funny story that I read on a magazine many years ago .
There was a group of experts invited to talk about the future of New York City in 1860 .
And in 1860 , a group of people gathered together , and guess what happened to New York City in the next 100 years , and the consensus was this : New York City will no longer exist in the next 100 years .
Why ? Because they look at the curves in the sketches and they say , if the population just grows on this scale , to move a population of New York City , they 'll need six million horses , and the waste from six million horses is not going to have a way of dealing with it .
They would be flooded with silk in horses .
So in 1860 , they saw this migrating technology that made life in New York City breathe .
So what happened ? For 40 years , to the time of 1900 , in the United States , there were 1 , 001 car-manufactured companies .
The idea of looking for a different technology is more than anything else , and there are very small factories in a state of stagnating .
Dearborn , MIchigan . Henry Ford .
However , there s a secret to working with entrepreneurs .
First of all , you have to give them security .
Otherwise they 're not going to go and talk to you .
Then you have to bring them an absolute , personal , enthusiastic service .
And then you have to tell them the truth about business .
The smallest company , the biggest company , has to be able to do three great things : The product you want to sell to you , you have to have a perfect promotional strategy , and you have to have a rating financial governance .
Think about it ?
We 've never met an individual in the world who s just been able to make , sell it and manage money at the same time .
That does n't exist .
This character was never born .
So we did a study , and we looked at 100 of the most typical companies in the world , Carnegie , Westinghouse , Edison , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There s only one thing that every successful company in the world has , only one , and that is : No company starts with one .
Now we teach businesses for 16-year-old adolescents in Northumberland , we started class by giving them the first two bills of Richard Branson s biography , and the task for these 16-year-old age is the bottom , in the first two pages of Richard Branson s biography how many times Richard Branson had me and how many times he used it .
We never have the word Me , and we 've got 32 times .
He did n't start alone .
Who started a company alone . Nobody .
So we can create a community where supporters have the fundamental experience of the small business model sitting in the cafeteria , the cafeteria , and your dedicated friends who will make you what someone else has given them talk about this hero , who will ask you , what do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you do it ?
Okay , can you sell it ? Can you manage money ?
Oh , no , I ca n't do this . Do you want me to find somebody else for you ?
We activate communities .
We have these supportive groups of volunteers who help Enterprise Flitator help them find resources and people , and we 've discovered that the miracle of indigenous people s intelligent minds like something like something that you can challenge the culture and economics of this community just by grasp the aspiration , the energy and imagination as your people .
Thank you .
By March , 2011 , I made a photographer in New York City .
We are the greenery creatures .
It s in the dark room , and it s in general avoiding the sun .
We tuned the more scooked , the more beautiful leather , turned the impossible to be , and we always got criticized in the press , but we also had talented artists for years of experience and to really understand images and photography .
In November 2011 , watching the world at home , I saw tragic events happening in Japan .
Then , the volunteer organization I was involved in All Hands Volunteers , in a couple of days , came to the scene to contribute to an attempt to react .
I , along with hundreds of volunteers , understand that it s impossible to sit still at home , so I decided to join them in three weeks .
On May 13th , I went to the town of California .
It s a small Iwate village , with about 50 , 000 people , one of the first places that was affected by tsunami .
The water force here is recorded for over 24 meters , and it goes over three miles in the land .
Imagine , the town was devastated .
We 're pulling fragments out of the channels , in the basement .
It cleans school , toilets , is ready for innovation and rehabilitation .
We cleaned tons of carcasses and sweat from local fish processing plants .
We 're lem , but everybody s happy .
For weeks , local volunteers and people were looking for one thing .
They were looking for images and albums and photographs and SD cards .
They all do that .
They 've been collecting and discussing them to protect in places around the social markets .
It was n't the time that I just realized these pictures were a very large part of the personal losses in these people .
When they run away from the waves , to keep the viability , they have left it all , everything is left behind .
On the first weekend there , I went to help a relief center in the town .
I cleaned up the hot air , the public hot shower .
It s also a place where the serenity center has been collecting pictures .
This is where people were talking to them , and that day I was honored , because they believed that I allowed me to help them clean the pictures .
It was so emotional and so excitement . I used to hear that I was supposed to think out of the box , but it was only when I really experienced that that wonder happens .
When I look at the photographs , there are some photos that are over a hundred years old , some are still in the envelope from the studio . I think , as a photojournalist I can fix my head and my shoes , and I know , hundreds of other people can do the same .
So that night , I went to Facebook and asked some people , and then in the morning , I got a lot of positive feedback , and I knew that I had to start working .
We started fixing these images .
This is the first one .
It s not damaged , but the permeated spot changes girl s face color , has to be repaired with precision and exquisite accuracy .
Otherwise , the girl in the image wo n't look like you anymore , and certainly it s as bad as the image is damaged .
Over time , very lucky , many images were coming back , and I needed modifies , so again , I went to Facebook and Linkedin , and over the course of five days , I found 80 people who wanted to help from 12 different countries .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people who wanted to participate .
In Japan , in July , we expanded Rikuzentakata s neighborhood , far north to the Yamada town .
Once a week , we installed our scanning equipment in the makeshift library that had been established before , so that people would come back and get their pictures .
Older women have sometimes never seen a scanner , but after 10 minutes , looking for her lost photo , giving us a scanner , uploading it to a cloud server , to download it by a gaijin , a stranger , somewhere in the world , and start to be corrected .
Time takes time to restore the cause to be a completely different story , and it s obviously dependent on the damage of the image .
It can take an hour . It can take a week .
It can take months .
The kimono in this picture has to be hand-painted , or grafted , from the colors and the rest of it has not been damaged .
It takes time .
Now , all of these images have been damaged , wretched in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes in oil , for a while , they 're going to continue to damage . So cleaning them up is a big part of the project .
We ca n't fix it if images are not clean , dry and retrofitted .
We were lucky with lasers .
There was a wonderful local woman who taught us .
It s easy to do more damage to these images .
My Wynne team once said , It s like tattoos for somebody .
You do n't have the opportunity to make mistakes .
The woman gave us these images that were lucky , when they were able to be so recovered .
She wiped them up and stopped realizing that she was doing more damage .
She also had a copy of the picture .
If you do n't , places like her husband and her face , you 'll never be able to fix them , you can just put them together in another good photo , and you 'll redo the whole picture .
When she got the pictures from us , she shared a little bit of her story .
These images have been found by her husband at a fire station , between the fragments that have been destroyed , and they 've realized him .
Day of tsunami , he was responsible for closing the tsunami doors .
He had to go towards the water when the warning was coming up .
Two little boys , not so young , her two sons are in school , two different schools .
One is trapped in the water .
It took a week to find them and learned that they all survived .
The day I returned to her was also the day of her son who was 14 years old .
For her , after all , these pictures were the perfect gift for him , something it could look back , to remember the past that had not been terrified from that March Day , when the whole life was broken or destroyed .
After six months in Japan , 1 , 100 volunteers have been involved in the Hands organization , including hundreds of people who have been wiped out more than 135 , 000 pictures , most — most of the photos have come back to their owner , and this is a very important thing .
Over five hundred global volunteers have helped pay more than 90 families , hundreds of photos have been completely recovered and corrected .
In this time , we were n't spending more than a thousand dollars on equipment and materials , most of the cost was for the printer inks .
We were taking pictures all the time .
Each image reminds someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
They 're our memories and our stories , which is the last thing we have to hang on and also the first thing we go back and look for .
It s the point of this whole project , restoring small pieces of humanity , bringing back connections to somebody .
When a picture like this comes back , it will make a big change in the lives of the receiver .
It also makes a big difference in the lives of the people who edited it .
For some people , they 've been connected to something big , giving away something , using their talents for something other than the skilled and the membrane leather .
I wanted to read an email to finish this talk . Email from Cindy , who helped fix me , sent me the day I came back from Japan after six months .
When I was working , I could n't think of every single body and stories that were contained in pictures .
There was a picture of many generations of women in the house , from old to young , clothing around a baby , who touched me because my house also had the same picture , my mom , my mom , my mom , my new daughter , the picture that hangs on the wall .
On the other side of the globe , no matter what time , our basic needs are the same , right ?
Thank you .
I was at the depth of 50 feet under an illegal mine in Ghana .
The air is particularly dust and hot , and it s very difficult to breathe .
I could feel the collision from sweaty bodies that sweat through the dark , but I could n't see it .
I heard the voice , but almost a basement is a mixture of coughing and the rock is broken with raw tools .
As you all , I had a cheap , low-cost battery lamp on my head , and it was attached to an old rubber ring , and I could hardly look at the shadows that were helping the walls of a 0 . 28 million-foot hole into the ground .
When I skipped my arm , I was missing the miner just a few days ago , and I had fallen into the basement .
When I 'm talking to you today , these guys are still at the bottom of that hole , taking their lives without salary or enthusiasm , and often they 're going to die .
I was climbed out of that hole , and I was home , but they would never be home , because they were in slavery .
For the last 28 years , I 've been documenting local culture in more than 70 countries in six continents , and in 2009 I 've had the privilege to be the only exhibitor at the Vancouver Summit for peace in Vancouver .
Of the incredible talents I met there , I met a supporter for the Empire Service , a member of NGO who was dedicated to killing the modern slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and indeed , I started to learn about slavery because I knew that it was around the world , but it was n't there .
After my talk , I was so terrifying and so shameful that I had no idea what this brutality was in my life , and I thought , if I do n't know , then how many people would n't know ?
It started to humiliate , so a couple of weeks later , I flew to Los Angles to meet the director of the Free Protection program and asked them to help .
And that began the journey into the modern slave world .
Now , strangely , I 've been to most of these places .
Some of the places I look at as my house .
But this time , I want to see the truth being veiled .
A rampant estimate tells us that there are over 27 million people who are enslaved into the world today .
That s twice the number of people removed from Africa during the Atlantic slave purchase .
150 years ago , a slave has tripled the annual income of an American worker .
That s like 50 , 000 U . S . dollars today .
But today , many generations of families are enslaved across generations with an 18-dollar debt .
Incredibly , slavery makes a profit over 13 billion dollars a year around the world .
A lot of people were fooled by the great promises of education , better work , just to see that they were arrested not under violence , and they could n't escape .
Today s rate of service for commerce , the goods that slaves create have value , but the creator is considered waste .
The slavery exists almost everywhere in the world , even though it s illegal everywhere .
In India and Nepal , I was sent to a brick oven .
This beautiful sight is like going into the old Egyptians world or Dante .
It s wrapped up in temperature of over 54 degrees centigrade , men , children , whole family , being bumped in a blind bush , doing things like the mare , putting bricks on top , up to 18 bricks a time , and bringing them from burnt ovens to trucks that were hundreds of meters away .
It s relieved by monotonity and exhausted , and they 're quiet and they 're quiet and they 're working again and again and again and again and again , 16 or 17 hours a day .
There s no food , there s no time to eat , and because of severe water loss , it s okay to go to urgency .
And the slash and dust spread so ubiquitous that my camera was so hot that I could n't touch the pause button .
Every 20 minutes , I have to run back to the wild car to wipe out the equipment and let it work under the heat of restoring it , and as I sit there , I think , my camera is more treated than others .
Back to the reactor , I just wanted to cry , but the dictator next to me quickly grabs me and says , Lisa , do n't do that . Do n't do that here .
He explained very well that expressions of emotions are very dangerous in this place , not to me , but to them .
I could n't help them directly .
I could n't give them money , nothing .
I 'm not the citizen .
I can put them in a worse situation than they are today .
I had to rely on the Free Intelligence Association to operate in the system to liberate them , and I believe they can .
For me , having to wait until home to really feel pain .
In the Himalayas , I saw that kids smashed across many miles of mountain terrain down the truck waiting in the lower road .
The big sheets are bigger than the kids who carry them , the kids who pick them up on their heads using the wooden frame , the rope and the fabric .
It s so heavy to see .
How do we make this monstrous thing , and what happens ?
Some people do n't even know that they 're being slaved , they work not 16 , 17 hours a day , because they only know .
They have nothing to compare .
When this village demanded freedom , the slaves burned their homes .
These people have nothing , they want to be dead , they want to be top of it , but the women in the middle of the town call for people to persist , and the existing cannibals help them get their contracts for their own quarries , so that now they still break their back , but they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
We tend to think about sex slavery when we hear from slavery , and because of this general awareness , I was told that it would be hard to do safe in this particular industry .
In Kathmandu , I was brought in by women who were sexual slavery .
They took me down to the narrow stairs down to the dirty basement , in the faint light .
This is actually not an Aboriginal place .
It s more like a restaurant .
The manure restaurants , as they 're known in the industry , are places of rape sex .
Every place there is a small room , where slaves , women , with kids and girls , some 7-year-old people , are forced to discharge their clients , let them buy more wine and more food .
The bedroom is dirty and dark , and it s recognized by the amount of paint on the wall by the jungle and the curtain .
The people who do this often have a tragic abuse under the hands of the client .
I remember feeling the fear of booming , and that moment , I just understood what it was like to be in hell .
There was only one way out : the staircase that I went in .
There s no backdoor .
There s not a big enough window .
These people have no escape way , when we talk about such a hard topic , have to remember that slavery , including the slavery of sexual trade , also happens in the places where we live .
There are tens of thousands of people who are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , filled with irritation in the house , and the list is long .
The New York Times recently reported that between 100 , 000 and 300 , 000 American children were sold as sexual slavery every year .
It s around us . We just do n't see it .
The textile industry is often thought of when you hear about slavery workers .
I went to many villages in India , where many of the families were slaved in the silk trade .
This is a family portrait .
The stain is the father , the blue hands and the red one is his son .
They put stains in big barrels , and they put silk in the liquid that was filled with their hands , even though the stains were very toxic .
My translator tells their stories .
They said , We do n't have freedom .
But there s hope that one day we can get out of this house and go somewhere else where we get paid in a canvas dye .
It s estimated that more than 4 , 000 children are slaving at the Volta lake , the largest artificial lake in the world .
When I first got there , I went through a turn .
I feel like a family is fishing on the boat , two brothers , a few smaller kids , it seems appropriate ?
False . They 're all slaves .
Children were taken from their families , smuggled and lost , and were caught up in the same lake , even though they did n't know how to swim .
This child is eight years old .
She was shaking when our ship got closer , just afraid to take the boat over her tiny canoe .
He was terrified of falling down to the water .
The branches are broken into the Volta lake , and the ones that are so tired and so terrified are pushing down the water to get rid of the tongue .
Many are drowned .
What he remembered , was he was caught in the lake .
Too afraid of the owner , she does n't dare to run away , and because of the damaged nature of the child , she continues to go on and down to the smaller slaves that she runs .
I met these boys at 5 a . m . in the morning , when they were pulling their last lines , but they were working at one in the morning .
On the cold night , the windmill winds .
Notice that these networks are heavy in nearly 500 , 000 kgs when they 're full of fish .
I 'd like to introduce Kofi to you .
Kofi was saved from a bathroom village .
I met him in the aid section that the Against Empire Rouge for slavery victims .
Here she s bathing in wells , and he s pouring the water on his head , and the great news is , when you and I sit here today , Kofi are united with the family , and even better , his family is given tools to earn a living and keep the kids safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
What would you become if someone would stand up and change your life ?
Driving cars on the street of Ghana , also colleagues at the Empire Proclaims , a guy of the slave people who were on a car shelf who were suddenly speeding up on our car and knocking on the glass doors .
He told us to follow the road in the woods .
At the end of the road , he urged us to get out of the car , and he kept driving right away .
And then you point to this blurry footprint and you say , Here s the pathway , here s the way . Go .
We followed that path , we lined up the street , and after about an hour of walking in the woods , the trace was sliced in the water after the rains , so I took a picture of my head as we went down to the deep water to the chest .
After two hours of sidewalks , the footprint around the neighborhood ended up in the empty space , and in front of our eyes it was a field of brutal craters , and they were filled with slaves .
A lot of women are on the back of the yellow interest , and they 're flowing through the fiber water .
The bank was used in the process of extracting .
These miners were arrested in the mine mine mine in another part of Ghana .
When they get out of the basement , they get swallowed by their own sweat .
I remember looking at their red eyes , and they were fatigue because a lot of people were below the ground until 72 hours .
The tunnels went down to a hundred meters , and they crushed on the heavy stone bags to move them to another area , where the rocks were crushed to the golden mine .
Look , the strike park seems to be filled with healthy people , but when you look closer , there s a lot more luck to working in a extreme situation , there s a whole bunch of kids .
They 're both victims of damage , disease and violence .
In fact , many of this muscle capacity will eventually look like this person , get T . B . tuberculosis and poisoning in a few years .
This is Manuru . When his father died , he got his attention to the working mine .
When the uncle died , Manuru inherited his debt , and was forced to enslave in this mine longer .
When I met , he worked for 14 years in the mine , and the wound on the leg you see is from a mine accident , so heavy that the physician said to me to saw .
First of all , Manuru had tuberculosis , but was still arrested day by day in the mine .
And yet , he dreamed of being free to go to school with the help of local activists like the Nation Production , and to be determined like this , emerged on the face of the extraordinary people , which made me overwhelmed with rebellion .
I want to slave in the light .
When I was working in this field , I brought in a lot of candles , with the help of translator , I transferred to people I took to photograph that I wanted to light their stories and their context , and when they and I were safe , I took these photographs .
They know that their pictures are going to be seen by people out there , like you .
I want them to know that we 're going to testify them , and we 're going to do anything we can to help them change their lives .
I truly believe , if we look at other people as human beings , it s very hard to drill pink crimes like slavery .
The images are not about the reputation itself . They 're about people , people , like you and me , all deserve equal rights , honor and respect in life .
There was no day when I did n't think of these wonderful people being buried around , and I had the great honor to meet them .
I hope that the images will wake up a powerful force in the viewer , people like you , and hopefully that power will spark the fire , that fire will shine in the slavery , because without that light , the monster of the prison will continue to live in the dark .
Thank you very much .
