When I was a kid , I thought , Well , the Korean vaccine is the best country in the world , and I often sing the song , We have no refugee .
I was very proud of my country .
In our school , we spend a lot of time learning about the life of the former Prime Minister of Irish -- Sung , but we do n't learn so much about the outside world , except for the United States , Korea and Japan , and Japan are our enemy .
I used to wonder what the world was out there , but I still thought I was going to spend my whole life in the Korea , until everything suddenly has changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw people firing open for the first time in my life , but I still think of my life here that s completely normal .
My family was not poor , and I was not starving .
But one day in 1995 , my mother came home from a letter from a siblings and was working with her mother .
And in there , it says , When you read those lines , my father-in-law is no longer here , because my whole family has nothing to eat for two weeks .
All at the top of the floor , and our bodies are so essential that they can feel death is coming .
I was shocked .
Because it was the first time that I knew that my people were suffering from this .
Shortly after that , when I walked into a station , I saw this incredible scene that I could never forget .
On the station is the death of a woman with two hands holding a tiny baby and a baby who only knows just staring at the face of her mother s face .
But nobody was helping them , because they were all concerned about their own and their own family .
In the mid-90s , North Korea suffered a severe famine .
It makes more than a million North Koreans die in starvation , and many who survive just to eat grass , beetles and beetles and bugs .
Building electricity more often happens , so everything around me goes into the dark when it comes to light from the Chinese side , just how my house is a river .
I always wonder why they have electricity , and we do n't have electricity .
This is a picture from the North Korea satellite at night in relation to the countries around us .
This is the Austrian River , which is a natural border between North Korea and China .
It can see that the river is very narrow , so some North Koreans are secret to China .
But a lot of people died .
And I saw them floating on the river .
I ca n't tell you how I 've been out of North Korea to say that in these tough years because of the famine that I was sent to China to live with a long-term relatives .
At the time , I just thought I 'd have to go away from my family a little bit of time .
I could never imagine that I would have been going to go away from them for 14 years .
In China , the life of a girl being separated from her family was as difficult as I was .
I had no idea what was going to happen to a refugee from North Korea , but I realized soon that it was n't going to be very difficult , but it was going to be very dangerous , because the refugees from North Korea in China were also considered immigrants .
I 've always lived in a constant fear that my identity will be detected , and I will be returned to the old life in North Korea .
One day , that nightmare came true , I was forced by the Chinese police officer and brought it to the police station to question .
Someone told them that I 'm an North Korean , so they tested my Mandarin ability and asked me a lot of questions .
I was so scared , it felt like my heart was about to explode .
Because if they see something unnatural , I 'm going to be thrown into prison and I 'm going back to water .
I think my life is about end , but I 'm still trying to control my emotions and answer their questions .
And after it s done , one of the two cops said to the other one , This is a false score .
It s not North Korea .
And they released me . That was a miracle .
Some of the North Koreans in China came to the foreign ambassadors to be refugee , but many of them were arrested by the Chinese police and were paid back to the country .
These girls are very lucky .
Because it s been arrested , but it s ultimately released by the force of the international community .
But these North Koreans are not so fortunate .
Every year , there s a lot of North Koreans being arrested in China and being rejected to water , where they 're being tortured , confined or executed .
And while I was very lucky that I was released , a lot of my cells were n't .
North Koreans have to cover their identities and fight to survive on being a tragedy .
Even if they 're learning Chinese and they find a job , then their life can be completely messed out in one single moment .
That s why , after 10 years of whaling identity I decided I 'd go to Korea , to start a new life again .
The stability of life here is much harder than I imagined .
Because in Korea , English is a very important position , so I started learning English , my third language .
I also realized there was a huge gap between North and North Korea .
We were all Koreans , but we were very different from the result of 67 years of being divided .
I went through a crisis of where I came from .
I 'm Korean or North Korea ?
Where do I come from ? And who am I ?
Suddenly , I did n't have a country to be proud of called the nation-state .
Although it s not that easy to accommodate life in Korea , I made a plan .
And they started to learn to test for college exams .
However , even though I 've been used to life here , I was given a terrible news .
North Korea government discovered the money I sent back to my family , and , in order to punishment , they would force my family to move back to a divorce area in the countryside .
So they quickly got out of it , and I started planning to help my family escape .
North Koreans have to overcome unthinkable distances .
Because the journey from North Korea to South Korea is almost impossible , so I had to fly to China and go backwards to the North Korea border .
Because my family did n't know the Chinese , so I had to go with everybody over 2 , 000 miles across China and go to Southeast Asia .
The bus journey lasted about a week , and we were almost caught .
Once , our car was stopped and was examined by a Chinese police officer .
He s got the evidence of everybody , and he s starting to ask .
Because my family did n't understand Chinese , so I thought they would be arrested .
When the Chinese police came close to them , I immediately stood up and told him these are the deaf people that I was dealing with .
He looked at me suspicious , but luckily he trusted me .
And we kept going to the grave to the Dutch border , and I had to use nearly the same amount that I had to bribe for the Dutch border guards .
However , after we crossed the border , my family was arrested in prison for offensive crime .
After I punished the sentence and gave the bribe , my family was released for a month , and was arrested again in the capital of Lesters .
It was the best time in my life .
I did all the way to take my family to liberty , and I was almost successful , but they were caught while we were still the Korean Embassy in a very short distance .
I went back to the local police department and the police department , hoping to get my family out of there , but I could n't afford to bribe or pay the punishment anymore .
I was desperately disappointed .
At the time , a guy said to me , What s going on ?
I was amazed that a completely strange person was interested in the question that I was .
In his little English and a dictionary , I told him the circumstances of my family , No doubt , that man went to the ATM machine , paid all the rest of my family and two North Koreans to be incarcerated .
I thank him with his heart , and I also asked him , Why are you helping me ?
I did n't help her , he said .
' I 'm helping the North Koreans .
I realized it was a really powerful moment in my life .
The kindness from the strangers became the new icon of hope for me and the North Koreans as we were looking at it , and he showed me the kindness from the strangers and the support of the international community was the hope that we were looking for .
Finally , after a long journey of mine and my family was gathered in Korea , but for freedom was only half of the struggle .
A lot of North Koreans are being divided with their families , and when they get to one country , they have to start with very little money or very little .
So we can take aid from the international community for education , to train English , to teach English , and many other areas .
We can also act as a bridge between the people in North Korea with the outside world , because there are so many of us who are still in touch with other families in the country , and we share that with them information and money to change North Korea from the inside .
I was very fortunate to get a lot of help and be inspired throughout my life , so I wanted to be able to share the power and bring it to my country a chance to grow up with international support .
I believe you 're going to see more and more North Koreans succeed all over the world , even on the TED stage .
Thank you .
Today I have only one request .
Do n't tell me that I 'm okay .
Now I want to introduce you to my brothers .
Remi is 22 years old , high and beautiful .
You ca n't speak , but you pass joy in the way that even some of the best heroes could n't do .
Remi knows what love is .
I 'm going to share it unconditionally no matter what .
He s not greedy . He s not racist .
I do n't care about the religious difference , and understand this : She s never lied .
When I sing songs from our childhood , trying to remember words that I could n't , she reminded me of one thing : we know very little about the brain , and what we do n't know is how great it was .
Samuel is 16 years old . He s high . He s very nice .
You have a perfectly good memory .
But it s also selective .
I do n't remember my first chocolate snorkel , but I remember the five songs of every song on my iPod , the conversations between us at four years old , yelling up on my hand , Teletubbies on my first wave , and the birthday of Lady Gaga .
It sounds great , is n't it ?
But most people would disagree .
And in fact , because their minds do n't fit into the normal social version , they 're often given and misunderstood .
But the thing that struck me even more was that , even though this was true , even though they were n't considered normal , it would only mean that they were extraordinary -- who were autistic and an anomaly .
For those of you who are not familiar with the phrase ' it s a brain disorder that affects our ability to communicate socially , learning and sometimes our physical abilities .
Disease in every single patient , that s why Remi is so different .
And all over the world , over 20 minutes , there s one person diagnosed with autism , and even though it s one of the fastest growing mental disorders in the world , we do n't know why or how to treat it .
And I ca n't remember for the first time when I had access to autism , but I could n't remember one day without it .
I was three years old when I was born , and I was so excited that there was a new person in my life .
And after a few months , I realized that I was different .
I yelled .
I do n't want to play like any other baby , and in fact , I do n't seem to be interested in me or anything .
Remi lives and restricts in his own world , with his own rules , and I find joy in the smallest of things , like motorcycle around the room and I 'm staring at the washing machine and eating anything in my hands .
As she grew up , she became more different , and the difference became clear .
But beyond the outward and the outrageous , overwhelming feature is something truly unique : a pure instinct and naive instinct , a boy that looks at his life without prejudice , a person that never lied .
Very common Africa .
Well , I could n't deny that there were some tough moments in my family , the moments that I wished were like them .
But I took my memories back to what they were teaching me about personality and communication and love and I realized that these were the things that I was not going to change to get normal .
Organization ignores the beauty that distinguishes us and what we 're different from each other does n't mean that there s something wrong with us .
It just means there s one right ' it s the other way .
And if I can just convey one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you , that is that you do n't have to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because whether or not we have autism , the difference between us -- we have a gift ! Everyone is carrying with us a gift , and frankly , the common chasing is the greatest potential .
The opportunities for great , progress and for change are shut when we 're trying to be like someone else .
So -- do n't say I 'm okay .
Thank you .
You may all agree with me that this is a beautiful path .
It s made of plastic , and plastic is the kind of cars that run on it that are very nightly , but it s not always , especially these days , when it s raining a lot .
Then you can get water on the road .
And especially if you ride a bike , and it s not nice to go through these cars .
Also , the plastics produce a lot of noise .
It s a dynamic material , if we do the same paths as the Netherlands , very close to the cities , we want a quiet path .
The solution to the problem is to make streets out of ports .
The spongy line is the material that we 're using right now to build most of the countries in the Netherlands , and it s got holes and water just melted through holes , so the whole rainwater is going to go out all the way , and you have a road path to drive . So there s no more water .
And the noise disappears through the supernova hole as well .
Because it s so hollow , all the noise is going to disappear , so it s very quiet .
Of course there s still a lot of inequity , and the uncomfortable thing about this line is the absence , and the bubble can happen .
What s the break ? You can see there on that path that the surface was burst out .
First you get a rock , then more and more , more , more , more , more , more , and then they -- oh , there we wo n't do that .
But they can break your car doors . So you 're not happy with that .
And then finally , the cracks are going to break more and more .
Sometimes they make chicken nuts .
Oh . He s ready .
Benjchicken , of course , could be a problem , but we have a solution .
Actually , you can see here that this material has a lot of damage .
It s porous plastic , as I said , you have just a small amount of kettles stuck between the stones .
The effect of the weather , the reflection of the sun , the thermo-bimetal , the moisture of this plastic , this helium that s intertwined between these cubes will be , and if it s compressed , it s going to have these little cracks that are really small , then bumped out of the building blocks .
And if you drive up the road there , you 'll destroy these blocks of attention -- as we just saw here .
In order to address this , we 've created self-assembly materials .
If we can create this self-assembly material , we can find the solution .
What we can do is we can use a steel bun for a bucket to clean it up , and we cut it into a big steel bucket , and we mix those little bits with the plastic clump .
So we have very small plastic pathways with very small steel debris .
And then you need a machine , as you can see here , that s the machine to cook -- a magnetic sensor .
The verb sensors can produce heat , especially steel is good .
What you do is you heat the steel hot , you melt the bitum , and the plastic bitum will melt into these micro-bumps , and the rocks will stick back to the surface .
I 'm using a microwave vessel today because I ca n't get my motorcycle sensor to the stage .
Automogenetics has the same system .
I put the prototype into the ovens , and now I 'm going to take it out . Let s see how it looks .
This is the prototype that s coming out .
I said we invented an industrial machine like this in the lab to heat the samples up .
At the lab we tried many samples , and then the government , they actually saw the results , and they said , Well , that s great . We have to try that .
Then they gave us a free route , 400 meters across the A58 River , and we had to create a new test pathway of this material .
So that s what we 've done here . You look at the pathway we 've done , and then of course this path is going to last for years without much damage . That s what we 've learned from our experimental experiments .
We took samples of samples from this path and we tried them in the lab .
So we aging the prototype , we put a lot of upload on it , put it together with a magnetic sensor , put it back together and then try it again .
We can do it over and over again .
And in fact , the conclusion with this research is that if we were to get the four years of roads attached to the machine -- this is a large-scale version that we built that would save the actual way -- if only four years we were able to feed the road once , we could actually double the life expectancy of the path , of course save it a lot .
Well , to wrap up , I can tell you that we 've created a kind of steel material , added it to steel , using a lot of thermal heat , to actually increase the length of the road , so that s twice as long as you 're able to make , and doubling the length of life expectancy with very simple techniques will save a lot of money .
Now you may be wondering if that s going to work .
We have the pattern here . It s pretty warm .
It should have been cooled before I showed you the effectiveness of the applicator .
But let me try that .
Look . Yes , it s attached .
Thank you .
I 'm here to talk to you today about a confusing question that is also confusing .
The subject is the secret to family violence , and the question I 'm asking is the question that people are always asking : Why is she staying ?
Why should she stay with the person who beat them ?
I 'm not a psychiatrist , I 'm not a social writer or a family violence expert .
I 'm just a woman who wants to share my story .
When I was 22 years old , I graduated from Harvard College .
I moved to New York City on my first job as a writer and editor for Seventeen magazine .
For the first time , I had my own apartment card , my own American Express card , and I had a big secret .
The secret was , this gun was thrown straight into my head by this man who I thought was a mate , from time to time .
I 've been in love with all the bullets in my head and threatened to kill me how many times I could n't remember .
I 'm here to tell you about insane love , a psychological tragedy made under the skin of love that millions of women and even some men have to keep on giving a year .
This could be your story .
I 'm not like a family violence counselor .
I have an English agency from Harvard University , and the marketing agency from the Wharton business school .
I started my career working for companies in the top 500 companies like Johnson and Johnson , Leo Burnett and the Washington Times .
I got married with my second husband for almost 20 years and I got together with three children .
My dog is like Black Lab , and I 'm driving Honda Odyssey .
So the first thing I want to talk to you about is domestic violence that happens to everyone around the world , every religion , every income and education .
It happens everywhere .
And the second thing I want to say is that people think that domestic violence has happened to women , that s a problem with women .
It s not true .
Over 85 percent of violence is men , and domestic violence takes place only in intimate , intimate , long-term relationships , in other words , in the last family , where we might want or expect to see the landmines , which is a reason for family violence to be a disruptive problem .
I told myself , I am the other person on Earth who used to be with the man who beat me , but in fact , I am a typical victim of my age .
I 'm 22 years old , living in the U . S . , that young woman between 16 and 24 is three times more likely to become a victim of domestic violence than women at any other age , and over 500 girls in this age are killed by nonviolent protests , brothers and sisters in the United States .
I was also a typical victim because I had no idea of the family violence , its warning signs or patterns .
I met Conor one night in a month , rainfall and cold .
He sat next to me in the New York City tunnel , and he started with me .
He told me two things .
One was he , like me , had just graduated from the Ivy League College and that he worked at a very impressive bank on Wall Street .
But the thing that struck me the first meeting was that he was smart enough and he looked like a farmer .
And he had these big , big , wizy-fi hair-looking hairstyles and hairstyles like the yellow field of gold , and he looked very sweet .
One of the smartest things Conor did , since the beginning , was to create the illusion that I was a promising relationship .
He did this particular thing in the beginning by respecting me .
We started dating , and he fell in love with me on all the way that I was intelligent , that I chose Harvard , that I fell in love with getting new girls growing up and doing work .
He wanted to know everything about my family and about my childhood , my hopes and dreams .
Conor believes me , as a writer and a woman in a way that nobody has .
And he also creates this incredible air of trust between us by acknowledging his secrets , that , as a child at the age of four , he s been abused by his staggering body and continually being quite bad at giving him back to school , although he s very smart and he s almost 20 years to rebuild his life .
That explains why the patents at Ivy Leage and how his brilliant work on Wall Street and the future really means a lot to him .
If you tell me that the smart , funny , sensitive man , beloved me one day when I was decorated or not , where my dress was going to be , where I was going to be , where I was going , where I was going , where I was from , and where I was from Christmas , I was going to smile on you because there was no excuse of either a traction of violence or control or control or control of Confucian at the very beginning .
I did n't know that the first time in any family violence was tempting and sexy .
I did n't know that the second stage was to isolate the victim .
Now , Conor did n't go back home one day and announce , Hey , you know , all this kind of Romeo and juliet are great , but I need to move on to the next stage where I 'm isolated and isolated -- so I need to take you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear her scream and go out of this city where their friends and family and friends can see the purposes .
Instead , Conor went home on a Friday night night night night , and he told me that he was out on his job today , and he said , because he left his job , because I made me feel safe and loved that he did n't have to show himself on Wall Street , and he just wanted to leave this city to go out in his unusual and uncomfortable place , to a town in England where he could start to live with me .
Now , the last thing I want to do is leave New York and my dream , but I thought that you had to sacrifice your life , so I agreed and take a break , Conor and I came together on Manhattan .
I did n't think that I was into a crazy love , that I was walking into some of the first steps in psychological traps , money and body arranged very carefully .
The next step in this violent scenario is to get in the face of the violent threat and see how she responds .
From here , the gun is coming in .
When we moved to New England -- you know , where Conor was based on feeling safe -- he bought three gun guns .
He kept a tree in the container of our car .
It s a knee under our bedside , a third tree , and he s always in the middle of his pajamas .
And he said he needed these bullets because of the suffering that he had spent in the past as a child .
He needed them to feel protected .
But these gun was actually a message for me , and although he did n't put my arm towards me , my life was in danger every single day .
Conor was attacked five days ago to our wedding .
It was seven o'clock in the morning when I was in my bedroom .
I 'm sitting on the roof , trying to be wild , trying to make a speech that was interacted , and I 'm frustrated , Conor using my anger as a defense to pull two arms around my neck and humiliate so close I ca n't breathe or scream , and he s using his head beating my head to the wall all the time .
Five days later , 10 bruises on my neck came up , and I dressed my mother s wedding dress , and I got married to him .
Despite what happened , I 'm sure we 're going to live happily because I love him and he loves me a lot .
And he was very promising .
He was really upset with my wedding and my family .
It was a separation , and he would never hurt me again .
It happened twice in a week of the moons .
For the first time , I was driving to find a secret beach , and I was lost , and he was beating on one side my head very thoroughly that kept me knocking on the door of the car .
A few days later , he was driving home after the moon , and he was tired of cars , and he threw the Big Mac in my face .
Conor went to hit me once a week for two months after two months and half years from marriage .
I was wrong to think that I was the only case and I was alone in this .
One third of American women go through domestic violence or have been abused during some of their lives and report CDC showing that 15 million children are being abused every year , 15 million children .
So I was in the company really good .
Back to my question : Why am I staying ?
The answer is very easy .
I do n't know that he s in violence with me .
Even picks up my head , puts me on the floor , threatens to kill my dogs , drags the keys out of my car when I 'm driving into the highway , pouring the coffee on my head when I 'm wearing my interviews , I never once thought of myself as being executed .
Instead , I 'm a strong woman in love with a man who has a problem , and I 'm the only person on the planet who can help Conor face his bad stuff .
The other question that people ask is , why did n't she just go away ?
Why did I not walk ? I could go away at any time .
For me , that was the most sad and harrowing question , because we victims know something that you do n't always know about : It was a terrible danger to leave a violent person out like this .
Because the last step in the family violence was killing her .
Over 70 percent of the march of domestic violence that happened after the victim ended up in a relationship , after she left , because then the violence had nothing to lose .
But the other consequence is that long after the protest , even after the prosecutors who were married ' the default from the financial resources ' and the movement of the whole family was to scare the victims ' and her children , these children were often forced by the judgment of the court of the court , with the men who had beaten their mothers .
And we keep asking , why did n't she abandon ?
I could have left , because the last cruel brutality had broken my words .
I realized that the man I was in love with would kill me if I lost him .
So I broke the silence .
I tell people , police , unfamiliar people , friends and family , who are totally strange , and I 'm here today because you 're helping me .
We have this idea of victims as scary headlines , women undermining themselves , good things that are damaged .
Question , Why is she staying ?
That s the reason for some people , that her fault is to be in the same position that the victims have chosen men with the intention of destroying us .
But since I published Crazy Love , I 've heard hundreds of stories from men and women who have gone away , who have learned an unbelievable life lesson from what s happened , and who have rebuilt the life -- happiness , joy -- like employees , mothers , mothers , mothers , life without violence , like me .
Because the fact that I was a typical victim of a family violence that ended me being a classic survivor of family violence .
I was married with a nice , kindergarten man , and we had three children .
I have a Black Lab dog and I have a Minivan .
What I 'd never done half , forever , is a shooter hit my head because someone said he loved me .
Now , you might be thinking , Oh , this is great , Oh , how could she be stupid , but all this time , I 've been talking about you .
I 'm sure some of you who are listening to me right now are people who are being abused or people who have been abused as being a child , or people who have been abused to themselves .
The absence can affect your daughter , your sister , your best friend , right now .
I can end my crazy story by exploding silence .
I 'm tearing the silence today .
This is how I help other victims , and this is my final request .
Let s talk about what you hear here .
Silence is just frightening in silence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by putting a light on it .
We need the victims who need it all .
We need you to understand the secret of family violence .
The abrovior of today s light absence by talking about it with your kids , your colleagues , your friends and your family .
Bring their lives as happy , as happy people , are worthy of the wider future .
Learning early signs of violence and the lie of conscience , reducing it , just showing the patron to the people that are safe .
Together we can make our bed bed nets and our families into peace and safety island .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about a group of very special animal species .
There are about 10 , 000 birds in the world .
It s one of the most endangered birds .
When you see a pride like this , the first thing that comes to mind is , these are the really weird , ugly creatures , involved and just targeting you , thinking about politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change the way that you spend these birds , because they need our compassion . They 're really needed .
Let me tell you why .
First of all , why are they so impressive ?
When Charles Darwin passed the Pacific in 1832 from Beagle , he saw the Turkish Turkish , and he said , These birds are ugly with the red head , the red gnarly was created to relieve in the jellyfish .
You ca n't get a lot worse than that , and those are the words from Charles Darwin .
You know , he changed his opinion when he came back , and let me tell you why .
They were also connected to Disneys -- being humanly personalized into messy , stupid characters , stupid characters .
More recently , if you 're watching the news in Kenya -- these are the particular features that are linked to Keya fighters , but I want to resist that .
I want to resist because you know what ?
Because the military does n't have a clean environment .
Seems ca n't help prevent the spread of disease .
They ca n't run a husband .
They are very old .
And , the thing that I love the most is , the girls look much better .
There are two different kinds of landscapes on the planet .
The World Health Organization was found mainly in the United States , such as the condor and caracaras then the World Trade Organization , where there are 16 species . Of these 16 species , there are 11 species with a high risk of extinction .
So , why is it important ? First of all , they provide essential ecosystems . They clean up .
These are really natural landscapes .
They cleaned up the dead bodies to the bottom of the bone .
They help kill bacteria . They helped them use the coal that they could spread and cause huge loss to feed animals and cause them to cause them to have diseases for other species .
The most recent studies have shown that in the areas that do n't have a homelessness that will take three to four times as much time to biodegrade , and the huge consequence of this is the spread of disease .
There s a great history of their importance .
They were connected to ancient Egyptians .
Nekhoff is the symbol of the guerrillas and the mother , and along with the snake , they symbolize the union of the Hunger Winter and the Enlightenment .
In Hindu , Jatayu is a meditation , and he risked a life to save the Sita from the head of 10 Ravana .
In Tibet culture , they do an incredible bidding , and in places like Tibet , there s nowhere to preserve people , or there s no wood to meditate on them , so the meditators provide a natural ecosystem of waste .
So what s in the middle of the pack ?
We have eight identical species in Kenya , where six species are at risk of an extinct genocide .
The reason is that they 're poisonous , they 're poisonous is because there are conflicts between humans and the wild world . These communities are using this toxic material to get into predators , but instead , the hyena is the victim for this .
In South Asia , countries like India and Pakistan , the four marinate species are labeled on incredibly high risk list , which means that they only have less than 10 or 15 years to reach the end of the genocide , and the reason it s because they 're turned into prey is being treated because they have to be treated with diarrhea .
This has been forbidden in medicine in India , and they 've shown that it s been used in medicine .
Because there s no money , so there s a huge spread of wild dogs in the area of animal waste when you have wild dogs , you have this huge , full-time bombsight of dengue fever . The number of mosquito diseases has increased a lot in India .
Kenya will have the largest wind farm in Africa with 353 engines that will be installed at Lake Turkana .
I 'm not against wind , but we need to work with government , because the wind engine makes the birds into this . They cut it in two .
These are the birds .
In West Africa there s a terrible municipal trade which is going to serve the magic market and the turtles .
So what did we do ? We 're doing research on these birds . We 're putting the signals into them .
We 're trying to figure out their basic ecology , and track where they came from .
We can see them moving across a lot of different countries , so if you focus only on the issues on the local scale , it s not going to work for you .
We need to work with government on the local level .
We 're working with local communities .
We 're talking to them about respect to the caves necessary for appreciating these magnificent creatures and the benefits that they have .
How do you help ? You can become an active person , create a voice . You can write letters to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these misunderstood creatures . Listen a little bit of time to the message .
And when you walk out into this room , you get information about the kittens , but tell your family , your children , your neighbor , your neighbor , your neighbor .
They 're compelling . Charles Darwin said , He changed his opinion because he saw them flying the form of attitude without any force in the sky .
Kenya , the world , it would be much worse if there were n't these wonderful animals .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 years old , I remembered one morning I woke up to hear the joy of my family .
My dad was hearing the news at the time of the BBC on his little gray radio .
He s growing a big smile , which is unusual because news often makes him worse .
And he goes , The Taliban are gone !
I did n't know at the time , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
Now you might actually go to school , and he said .
One morning I could n't forget .
It s a real school .
You know , the Taliban went to Afghanistan since I was six years old and stopped girls from going to school .
Over the next five years , I was dressed as a son to go with my sister to a secret school because my sister was banned from the house alone .
It was the only way that we could go to school .
Every day , we go in different ways so that nobody is suspicious about our destination .
We hid books in the marketplace like this , and people think we 're just going to shopping .
That school in a house , more than 100 of us , we were beaten in a small living room .
Pretty warm in the winter , but it s extremely hot .
We all know that we 're risking our own lives of teachers , students and our parents .
Sometimes , the school suddenly shuts out about a week because the Taliban suspect .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Are we watched ?
Do they know where we are ?
We were terrified , but still , we wanted to go to school .
I was fortunate enough to be raised in a family who was very respectful of education and girls .
My grandfather was a very serendipitous person at the time .
One was completely dismissed from a standpoint in Afghanistan , and he was insisted for his daughter , and his mother went to school , and so his father gave up .
But my mother had an education to be a teacher .
Here she is .
She retired two years ago to use our house to open up the school for the women and women in their neighbors .
And this is my father s father who was the first person in his family to be educated .
No doubt his children will be educated , including his daughter , regardless of the Taliban , and despite the dangers .
For him , children who are not taught are more likely to be a threat .
In the Taliban years , I remember that there were times when I was very angry about our lives and were always frightened and unable to see the future .
I would love to give up school , but my father would say , Listen to your daughter , you can lose everything you have in your life .
Your eyebrows can be stepped . You can be fired from your house during the war .
But one thing will forever live with your kids is this , and if we 're forced to sell blood to pay for obesity , we 're going to do that .
Do you want me to go on ?
I 'm 22 years old today .
I had grown up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war .
Less than six percent of the young women I went to high school , and if my family was n't committed to my education , I was also one of them .
But I 'm proud to be standing here as a graduate student at Middlebury College .
When I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was discarded by his family because he dared to let his daughter go to school , was one of the first people to celebrate me .
He was n't just about my high school equality , he was the first woman , and I was the first woman to be able to transport him in the streets of Kabul .
My family believed me .
I dream big , but my family wishes for me even larger .
So I 'm the global ambassador for 1010 , and this is the global campaigning for women .
So I helped set up SOLA , the first school and certainly the only college for girls in Afghanistan , a country that is in danger for girls to go to school .
I was very excited to see my students coming to my school with hopes to embrace this opportunity .
And I see their parents and their parents like my dad , supporting them , regardless and even in many other conflict .
It was like Ahmed . It was n't his real name , and I could n't tell his face , but Ahmed was my father .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on the way to SOLA from their village , and they were literally killed because of a bomb on the street in just a few minutes .
When he got home , the phone responded , a threatening voice for him if he continued to take his daughter to school , they would try it again .
And he said , If you want to kill me , but I 'm not going to destroy my daughter s future for the back-to-back and back-to-front ideology of the people .
I 'm now aware of Afghanistan , and this is what s often ignored in the West , is that behind most successful people , we are a father who honored the value of their daughters and saw their daughters succeed as their own success .
This is not saying that mothers are not important in our success .
In fact , they 're the first , and they 're persuasive to the future of their daughters , but in a social situation like Afghanistan , we need the support of men .
Under the Taliban , girls went to school for hundreds of people who remember , that s illegal .
But today , over three million women are in school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks very different from the U . S .
I find that Americans see a weak , fragile weakness of changes .
I 'm afraid that all of those changes wo n't be longer after the U . S . army escaped .
But when I go back to Afghanistan , when I see my students in my school and my parents support them , encourage them , I see a promising future and the change will last forever .
For me , Afghanistan was a country of hope , unlimited capacity , and every single day SOLA reminded me of that .
Like me , they have big dreams .
Thank you .
Hi . This is my cell phone .
A cell phone can change your life , and a cell phone can give you personal freedom .
With a cell phone , you can record images of human rights abuses in Syria .
With a cell phone , you can post a message on Tweeter and start a protest against government in Egypt .
And also with a phone you can record a song , post it on SoundCloud and become famous .
All of this can be done with your cellphone .
I 'm a child of 1984 , and I live in Berlin City .
Let s go back to that moment , in this city .
You can see here how thousands of people stand up and vote for change .
It was the fall of 1989 , and imagine the people who stood up and protested for that change , there was a cell phone in their pockets .
Who in the room has a cell phone ?
Just raise it .
Raise your cell phone up , raise your phone !
Please raise it up . A Android phone , Blackberry , wow .
A lot . Today , most of us have a cell phone .
But today I 'm going to talk about myself and my cellphone , and how it has changed my life .
I 'm going to talk to you about that .
There are 35830 stream of information .
Simple information .
But why is that information there ?
The reason is because in the summer of 2006 , the European Committee of the E . U . recommended only one formal indicator .
It s called data warning .
This is just showing that every telecommunications company in Europe , every single Internet service provider in the European territory , has to store an enormous amount of information about the users .
Who called ? Who sent someone an email ?
Who sent mobile messages ?
And if you use a cell phone , this is where the problem exists .
All this information is stored at least six months , until two years by the network that you 're using or the Internet service providers .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , We do n't want to .
They said , We do n't want this information .
We want to get the autonomy in the digital age , and we do n't want that the telecommunications companies and the Internet service providers all of our information .
They 're lawyers , journalists , journalists and fathers , and they all say , We do n't want that .
And you can see here , like 10 , 000 people participate in the streets of Berlin and the Berlin Illuminous Coalition , not afraid .
And some people even said , it s like Stasi 2 . 0 .
Stasi is the police force that works in Eastern Germany .
I also asked myself , does it actually work ?
Can they store all of our information ?
Every time we use our mobile phones ?
So I asked my Internet to use , Deutsche Telekom , the German Internet provider at the time , and I asked them , Please , please send me all of my information that they had stored .
I asked them to send me just once , and I kept asking , but what I got was just an unobvious answer . Blah blah blah blah blah .
But then I said , I want to get this information , because they 're archiving my life .
And so I decided to send a case to the court , because I wanted to get this information .
But Deutsche Telekom said , no , we 're not going to give you this information .
And finally , I had a deal with them .
I 'm going to destroy , and they 're going to give me this information that I 'm asking for .
Because at that time , the Federal Reserve Act declared that the European Association was not working in the German constitution system .
So I got this ugly orthopedic envelope with a CD inside .
And on a CD , what I needed was recorded on that CD .
358830 milliseconds of information .
First I looked at it , and I said , Okay . It s a big data file . Good .
But then I realized , this is all my life .
This is my six months of life , documented in all of this data .
And then I wonder a little bit , what should we do with it ?
Because I can see where I 've been , where I 've slept every night , what I 've done .
But then I said , I want to publish this information .
I wanted it to be seen by the public .
Because I wanted to show you what data storm really is .
So for Zeit Online and Open Data City , I do the same thing .
These are live images of my six months of life that have been recorded .
You can zoom in , you can zoom in , you can zoom back and get faster .
You can see my step by step .
You may not even know how I came to Franklotrot with a train to Cologne , and the frequency I called the telephone between those two places .
We can all have this information .
I had a bit of fear .
But that information is not just about me .
It s information about us all .
First of all , it s just like this , I call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other three times .
And then some friends call me , they call me again .
And then you call you , and you call you , and you get this huge communication network .
But you can see how we communicate with each other , they call each other , when they go to sleep .
You can see it all .
You can see the most important parts , like the leaders in a group .
If you have access to these information , you can see the behavior of the community , the society .
If you have access to this information , you can control the whole society .
This is a drawing of design for countries like China or Iran .
This is a drawing of how to survey society , because you can know who s talking to someone , who s sent email , all of it s possible if you have access to this information .
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe , until about two years .
As I said , when I started , imagine if all of these guys on the streets of Berlin were harvesting in 1989 there was a cell phone in their pockets .
Maybe Stasi would know who was involved in this demonstration , and if Stasi knew who was the leader behind it , it would never have been possible .
Berlin s collapse would not have been possible .
And if so , perhaps the collapse of the Iron Telescope would n't exist .
Because nowadays , functional agencies and companies want to record information that they have about us as much as we can , online and online .
They want to be able to track our lives , and so they want to keep this information from happening all the time .
Liberalism and living in a digital age is not conflict .
What you should do is fight for your autonomy today .
And you have to fight it endlessly every day .
Then , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and that s not an obsolete .
When you go home , just tell your representative people that because companies and functional agencies are able to keep information in particular , even though they do n't necessarily have to .
And if you do n't trust me , ask the network to provide this information that they 've stored about them .
So , in the future , whenever you use your cell phone to remind you that you have to fight for personal autonomy in this digital age .
Thank you .
Photography is my passion since I was big enough to hold a camera , but today I want to share with you 15 images that I most respect , and I do n't take one of those myself .
There s no art director , there s no model , there s no samples , there s no pictures , there s not even paying attention to light .
In fact , most of them were taken by random passengers .
The story begins when I arrived in New York City to participate in a speech and my wife took a picture of me holding my daughter on his first birthday . We were standing on the 57 and a half line .
We happened to go back to New York a year later , so we decided to take a picture like that .
You can see where this story is taking place .
When I was about to take my daughter s third birthday , my wife said , Why do n't you take Sabrina to New York on an expedition that has just my father and daughter , and then go on to the old ritual ?
Since then we 've started to ask our passenger to travel through a picture .
You know , the act of interacting your camera with a totally strange person around the world is remarkable .
No one s going to refuse , and luckily nobody s going to run with our camera .
At the time , we had no idea how that journey would change our lives .
It became sacred to us .
This photograph was taken a few weeks after 9 / 11 , and I managed to explain what happened that day in the way that a five year-old could understand .
These pictures are not just representative of a moment , or a particular journey .
They 're the way we stop for a week of October , thinking about our time and how we change every year , not just physically , but in every way .
Because even though we take the same picture , our children s point of view changes , my daughter gains new traces , and I see the life through her eyes , how it looks and interact with things .
The time that we spend on each other is something that we honor and expect for the whole year .
Recently , on a trip , we were walking , and my daughter suddenly stopped in the middle of the road , and it was just coming to the red roof of the concrete store that she loved as a kid on our early days .
She described it to me when she was five years old , when she was in that position .
It says that it remembers its heart s out of its chest when it first sees the store for the first time , nine years .
And now what it saw in New York was university , because it decided to go to school in New York .
And I realized : one of the most important things we make is memory .
So I want to share the idea of playing an active role in creating memories .
I do n't know about all of you , but beyond 15 of these images , I do n't show up quite so much in my family photographs .
I 'm always the photographer .
So I want to encourage all of you to be in the picture today , and not be afraid to step to someone , and say , Can you take a picture of us ?
Thank you .
I 'll never forget the words my grandmother used to say -- she died in this forgiveness : Hey , let s fight Gaddafi . Let s fight him .
But do n't turn to a kind of Gaddafi revolution .
For almost two years , it has been passed since the Khmer Rouge in Libya , it s been augmented by large wave wave wave wave wave explosions from the beginning of Tunisia and Egypt .
I joined forces in and outside Libya to call for the day of madness and to start a resistance against Gaddafi regime .
And it s a huge revolution .
The young men at the top of the front lines requiring the government , raising the voices of freedom , dignity , social justice .
They showed a mirror of compassion in dealing with Gaddafi s brutal dictatorship .
They showed a corrupt of paint union that was spread from eastern to eastern and would stretch all the way up to the south .
Finally , after six months of defeat with the total mortality of 50 , 000 people , we managed to release our country and toss the tyranny .
However , Gaddafi left a burden , a heritage of authoritarian regimes , corruption and springs .
For four decades , the violent discipline of Gaddafi has destroyed the infrastructure and the culture and the ethnicity of Libya society .
Learning is about destroying and challenging , I am , like so many other women , who are at the rebuilding of Libya s civil society , asking for the comprehension and the transition to democracy .
Almost 200 organizations were founded in Benghazi during that time and right after Gaddafi collapsed -- nearly 300 at Tripoli .
After 33 years of forgiveness , I went back to Libya , and with my single passion , I started to organize the training classes to improve strength , to improve people on leadership skills .
In the same group of women , I co-founded the Women s Health Corporation for Republicans of Republicans , a movement of women , of leaders from all different parts of the society , to lobby for political empowerment for women and to campaigning for our rights to be engaged in building peace and peace .
I was in a very difficult situation where the voting agency , a more polarized environment , a environment that was created by a very dominated , very dominant political view of politics and exclusion .
I led a initiative of Libya Women s Health for Resistance to lobby for a more inclusive election laws that could lead to every citizen , regardless of how they came to be elected and elected , and most importantly , the regulatory group of political parties had to fit the men and women along the way , and on their list they created a list of drawings .
Finally our initiative was accepted and successful .
Women won 17 and a half percent in the Council of Parliament in the first few years .
However , just a little bit , the excitement from the elections and the general revolution disappeared -- when every day we woke up with news about violence .
We woke up one day with news about the adventure of the Sufi church and the fan of the Sufi people .
We woke up the other day with news about the U . S . ambassador and attacked the stadiums .
We woke up the other day with the information about the police officer of the army .
And every day we wake up with the rules of military forces and their continuity to the people s right to inmates and the disrespectability of the laws of their laws .
Our societies , our societies , formed by innovative thinking , became more polarized and left the ideas , the principles of freedom , the price , the social inequality that we followed in the first place .
Ideally , exclusion and hostility became a symbol of the beginning .
I 'm not here to inspire you with the successful story of creating a list of drawings and elections .
And I 'm here to admit that we -- the whole country made a mistake , made a mistake .
We did n't prioritize the civil rights .
Because elections do n't bring peace , stability or security to Libya .
Is the list of drawings and excuses between male and female candidates that bring peace and reconciliation to the country ?
No , no .
So what did it help ?
Why do we continue as a polarized and dominated society by the elderly politics of dominance and exclusion , by both men and women ?
Perhaps death is not just about women s rights , but about women s values of compassion , of tolerance , of tolerance , and inclusion .
Our societies need a national dialogue and our coalition rather than the elections , which have only increased polarization and division .
Our societies need more of a sexual representation of women than just numbers and numbers of female representatives .
We needed to stop acting like idiots , we needed to stop supporting incredible days .
We needed to start acting as the ambassadors of compassion and tolerance .
We needed to develop a feminist conversation that was not only honored but also suited , rather than hostile , collaborative rather than exclusive .
These are the ideas necessary that a country has been devastating like Libya is absolutely necessary to chew peace .
Because peace is like a billionaire , it needs a conviction of ideas between men and women .
That s a real keyboard .
And we need to set up the survival factor before we do political work .
In a verse from the Salam Koran -- peace -- is the word tolerant , raheem .
Next , from raheem as known in the tradition of Abraham that they share a common origin with the Arabic language of rahem -- the sex for women -- surrounded by women and women , from all walks of life , all tribes , are born .
And because the uterus is so full of embryo that is growing in its belly , the sacred drum of compassion feeds the rest of its life .
So we 're told that our tolerance is full of all kinds of things .
So we 're told that our tolerance has been through a huge victory .
Either we get all of our support for tolerance .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I experienced a little bit like Alice in the first place .
Penn State asked me , a teacher who teaches me to communicate an instruction to the technology students .
I was scared .
It s really scary . It s dreaming the big students , the big books , and also the very strange ones .
But when the exchange was opened , I experienced what Alice was experiencing as she fell down on the hillside and discovered the door that led to a new world .
That s just what I feel when I talk to the students . I 'm amazed by their ideas , and I want others to be aware of this pioneering spirit .
I believe the key to opening the door to the world is our ability to communicate well .
We 're incredibly efficient at communicating with scientists and engineers to change the world .
The scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing the biggest challenges , from energy to the environment , and so on , and so forth , if we do n't know and do n't understand that , it s not going to be done , and I believe our responsibility , the experts , are not interact with them .
But efficient conversations ca n't work if scientists and engineers ca n't get us to their place .
As scientists and engineers , eight funny stories with us .
I 'd like to share some mysteries with you to make sure that our scientific discoveries are so fascinating , that it s also fascinating , it s hot .
The first one is : What ?
Why does science have to do with us ?
Now , do n't just say you study bone tissue , but let s say you work on bone tissue tissue tissue tissue tissue , it s like the fibers that make our bones , because we need to know about bone disorders and cure .
When you describe science , be careful to use the term .
Language stops us from understanding his ideas .
You might say spatial and the tempo , but why not use space and time .
Make an idea so easy to understand is not to lower them .
Instead , as Anh-tablet said , it s as simple as it is , but not simpler .
Clearly , you can talk about scientific issues without interlocking ideas .
So it s about giving examples , telling stories , interacting with symbols , and it s about getting us excited about what he s talking about .
And by the way , do n't use the headlines .
Have you ever wondered why you call them the headline ?
What about when the bricks go away ? Type II is deleting the window , killing it all the time , and they will also kill your talk .
A slide like this , not only does a cliché , but it depends too much on the part of the brain , which makes us crippled .
Instead , this slide , Genevieve Brown s example is actually more real . It shows the special structure of bone tissue that s so powerful that it s really inspirational for the unique design of the University of Josehip-gen .
And the trick here is to use simple and easy sentences to read the audience if they 're not there before , and then to use the visual image to help us deeply understand what s being shown .
I think these are just a few mysteries that help us open that door and see the pride of science and technology .
My engineers who work with me have to know how to rationalize everything . So I want to summarize it with a equation .
Take the science and the terminology and the terminology and then share it with the authenticity , which is sharing the exact explanations for the audience , and then the passion that he s given to the work that he s doing , is going to come up with , is going to come the most amazing interaction .
And so , as scientists and engineers , when you solve this equation , at all expenses , let s talk about eight tricks to me .
Thank you .
Hi . I 'm Cameron Russell , and in the short run , I 'm a model .
Actually , 10 years .
And I feel that there s an uncomfortable pressure in this room right now because I should n't wear this one .
Fortunately , I have a different suit .
This is the first time someone has a TED Talk , so I think you 're very lucky to see this .
If some women are frightened when I show up , you do n't have to tell me where I am right now , but then I 'll go through Twitter .
I realize I 'm very lucky to be able to change what you think about me for 10 seconds in short .
Not everyone has the opportunity to do this .
These high-heeled shoes are very uncomfortable , and I 'm not going to take them .
The worst part is this long clothing that goes through my head because you 're always laughing at me , so do n't do anything when it s on my head .
That s it .
Why did I do that ?
It s kind of weird .
In fact , I hope it s not that unbelievable as this picture .
Now , visual imagery is very powerful , but it s very artificiality .
I 've just changed everything you think about me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I actually did n't have any boys in my life .
I was so uncomfortable at the time , and the photographer told me to spend my hand on his hair .
And of course , except for surgery , or the prosthetic light that I had two days ago to take , there were very few things that we could do to change our appearance , and in fact , even though it was artificial and hard to change , it had a huge impact on our lives .
So today , to me , there is no fear of being true to the truth .
And I 'm standing on this stage because I 'm a model person .
I stand on this stage because I 'm beautiful , a white woman , and in the humanities , we call it a sexy girl .
And I 'm going to answer the questions that people are always asking me , but with the truth .
The first question is , how do I become a model ?
And I always say , Oh , I was discovered , but it did n't make any sense .
In fact , I 'm a sample because I won the genetic lottery , and I 'm an advocate , and you 're probably wondering what inherent property is .
In the last few decades , we 've defined beauty not just as healthy and young and young , but as opposed to the symmetry that we 're programmed in to crave desire , also to be tall , to be tall , to be gentle , to be gentle , to be gentle , to be white , to be white and to be white .
This is the legacy that was built for me , and that s the legacy that I made for it .
I know some of you are skeptical about this , and maybe some of you are dressed in beautiful dress like , Hang . Naomi . com . Joan Smalls . Liu Wen .
I want to salute your model . It s very impressive .
But unfortunately , I have to tell you in 2007 , a Ph . D . student at the University of New York said that all models on the floor , and in 67 they were hired by only 27 people , fewer than four percent , are not white .
The next question people are always asking me is : Can you become a model when you 're growing up ?
And my first answer was : You know , you 're not in charge of recruitment .
But the next answer I really want to talk to girls is , Why ?
You know what ? You can become anyone .
You can become the president of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a cardiologist , cardiologist , cardiovascular surgery , would be great , because you 're going to be the first to do it .
If , after a really interesting list , they said , No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , then I 'll say , Make your boss go .
Because you have no power , you can be the sum of Vogue magazine in the United States or the governor of H & M , or Steven Meisel s .
Tell me I wanted to be a model when I was growing up , like I said I wanted to win a lottery when I was growing up .
It s out of my control , and it s great , but it s not a career path .
I 'm going to show you -- for 10 years of my experience I accumulated as a model , because it s not like a cardiologist , so it s just a little bit of a short time .
If the photographer is standing here and the light is there , it s like a beautiful interaction , and when the client says , Cameron , we want this picture that you 're going to walk , so this one s going forward , this one s beautiful , beautiful , and this one s going to go forward , and then it s going to be on , it s going to be at the front , and you 're just going to go back , and then you 're going to look at your head , and then you 're going to imagine , and then you 're going to see 300 times , 500 times , 500 times , 000 times , 000 times , and then it s a friends .
It s like this .
So hopefully it s smaller than the picture in the middle .
I had no idea what was going on in the same time .
Sadly after you 've finished school , you write Quésumé and you 've done a couple of things , you ca n't say anything else , because if you say you want to be the U . S . president , but your check : The guru is 10 years old : 10 years old , people will look at you with a stranger .
The next question that people are always asking me is : Is all these images edited ?
Right , pretty much all of these images are edited , but that s just a small part of what s going on .
This was one of the first images that I ever photographed , was the first time I took a bathtub , and I did n't even have a menstrual cycle .
I know we 're going to go into personal stories , but I was a little girl .
This is my grandmother s appearance , a few months ago with her grandmother .
This is me in the same day when I took this picture .
My girlfriend and I were walking along with me .
This is me at the dinner party a couple of days before we did this picture for the Vogue in France .
This is me with the football team in V magazine .
And here I am .
I hope you can see -- these are not my images .
These are images being built , and it s built by a group of experts , hairstyles , graffiti professionals , photographers , photographers , and all their leaders , mass-manufactured , and they 're all made of this . That s not me .
The next question I get to ask people is , What are you given for for for free ?
I have a lot of high heels in the 20-heel that I never have , which is the exception , but the free thing that I get is that I have in the real world , and those are the things that we do n't want to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and at one point , I went to the store , and I forgot to take the money and they gave me free of a coat .
When I was a little girl , I was sitting in a car with a friend who was a terrified driver , and she was out of red light , and we were stopped , and all I did was say , Sorry the police , and we could go .
I have all these free things because of my look , it s not because I 'm who I am and there are people who are willing to spend a lot of money on their appearance , it s not who they are .
I lived in New York , and last year , in 140 , 000 teenagers were arrested and disciplined , there were 86 percent black and Hispanic , mostly young men .
In New York , there are only 177 , 000 black and Latin people , so for them , the question is , Am I arrested ?
I 'm going to be arrested and when ?
When I was preparing this talk , I found that 53 percent of the 13 percent of the 13 year-old girls in the United States do n't like their bodies , and this figure was up to 78 percent when they were 17 years old .
The last question people ask me is : How does it feel to be the prototype ?
I think what they want to hear is that if you 're a little bit more elegant , and your hair is a little more elegant , you 're going to be happy and excited .
And when we were behind the chicken , we came up with something like this .
It s great to travel , and it s great to work with people who are creative , inspiring and passionate .
And those are the facts , but that s only half of them , because that s what we never say in front of the lens , which I never said before , is : I 'm safe .
I was unsecure because I had to think about my image every day .
And you ever ask yourself , If your thighs are denser than your hair , would you be happier ?
You just meet a group of samples , because they have the most skeletons , the wingest hair and the most beautiful ones on the planet , and they 're probably the most intimate women on the planet .
When I was writing this talk , it was difficult for me to find the truth , because on the one hand , I felt very comfortable being here to say , I 've got all this because I 've been lucky enough to go after it , and it s not making me happy .
But mostly it s hard to disrupt a sexual heritage and ethnic problem while I 'm one of the biggest benefits .
But I 'm also excited and excited to be here , and I think it s lucky that I was coming before 10 , 20 or 30 years ago , and I 'd been working with a lot of companies in my career , because then I could n't tell how I had my first job , or I would n't be talking about how I had a cost-effective job , but it seemed like I had a lot of money right now .
If there s something reluctant to this talk , I hope it s all we 're all comfortable with acknowledging the power of the visual image of our success and failure .
Thank you .
There are so many ways that people around us can improve our lives .
We do n't touch each other , so there s a lot of wisdom we 're never aware of , even though we share public spaces .
So over the past few years , I 've been working on a lot to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like papercutting , packing , punch pad and pollen .
And these projects came from the questions I was asking , like , how much would my neighbors pay for their families ?
How do we borrow and borrow more things without typing in their homes at bad times ?
How do we share more of our memories of abandoned buildings , and have we learned better about our situation ?
And how do we share much more of our hopes for empty , so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams ?
Now , I live in New Orleans , and I love New Orleans .
My soul has always been cooled by these huge , enthusiastic trees who are in love , who are drunk and dreamers of dreamers for hundreds of years , and I believe in a city that has always been in its place for music .
I felt like every time someone shocked , New Orleans had a march .
Cities have some of the most beautiful architectural structures in the world , but it also has some of the biggest democracies that are abandoned in the U . S .
I live near this house , and I think how I can make it a better place for my neighborhood , and I also think about something that can change my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost one of my beloved people .
Her name was Joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was unexpected and unexpected .
And I was thinking about death a lot , and this made me feel so grateful for the times that I had , and it was giving clarity to the things that make sense of my life now .
But I 'm fighting to maintain this view in my daily life .
I feel like it s so easy to grasp through the day , and to forget what it really means to you .
So with the help of these old and new friends , I moved on a side of this abandoned building into a giant , huge fan board with a question : Before I die , I would like . . . so that anyone walking across the road can pick up a piece of pollen , reflect their own personal aspiration in the public space .
I had no idea what to expect from this experiment , but the next day the wall was completely closed , and it continued to evolve .
And I want to share something about what people write on that wall .
Before I die , I want to try robbery .
Before I die , I wanted to be on the streets of the International Day .
Before I die , I want to sing for millions of people .
Before I die , I want to grow a tree .
Before I die , I want to live outside of the magic .
Before I die , I want to get her again .
Before I die , I wanted to be someone s soldier .
Before I die , I wanted to be completely alone .
So this abandoned space became an architectural space , and the hopes and dreams of people making me laugh , the tears , and they stuck me in my difficult times .
It s about knowing that you 're not alone .
It s understanding the people around us in new and creative ways .
It s about creating the space for reflection and infancy , and remembering what really matters most to us as adults and as we grow up .
I did this project last year , and I started getting hundreds of letters from the enthusiasm who wanted to make a wall in their community , so the central residents of the community and I made a tool , and now the walls are being done in countries in the world , including Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , Australia , Australia , Austria and more .
Together , we 've shown how powerful our public spaces are if we 're given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
Two most important things that we have are time and interaction with other people .
In our age to increase our dispersal , this is even more important than ever before to find a way to maintain vision and remember that life is short and soft .
What death is something we 're often not really encouraged to talk about or even think about , but I 've been finding out that death is one of the most powerful things you can do .
Think about the death that makes your life clear .
Our shared spaces can be better reflected on what happens to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share hope , fear and stories , the people around us not only can help us to do better things , they can help us lead our lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , I do an app math problem , and this is a strange problem for anyone to do an app problem , which is we 're like managers .
Nobody knows what we 're doing .
So today I 'm going to try to explain to you what I do .
Well , dance is one of the things that people normally do .
We love the helicopter dancers of Lord and Stage Drawing the feet that you 'll see in a second .
Three goats require a special discipline of expertise and high-tech processes and can be relevant to the subject to the subject .
Sadly , mental disorders such as Parkinson s have graduated this particular capacity , as what s happening to my friend Jan Stripling , who , once , was a great artist .
Over the years there has been tremendous improvement in treatment .
However , 6 . 3 million people worldwide are infected , and they have to live in a state of depression , turbulence , dystonia and other symptoms that are being treated with this disease . What we need are the tools to identify the disease before it s too late .
We need to measure our progress very objectively , and finally , the only way we know when we actually have a treatment , is when we have a very precise way to be able to answer .
But very frustrating is that with Parkinson s and other mental disorders , they do n't have a biological footprint , so there s no simple blood testing method you can do , and the best thing we have is this neurological test .
You need to go to the hospital to do that . It s very expensive , which means that this is a trial outside of clinical trials , it s never been done .
But what if the patient could do this at home ?
It would really be a trip to the clinic , and what if the patient could also do the experiment itself , what about the patient ?
We do n't spend our time in the prime time .
For about 300 dollars , to do this at the Medical Lab in neuroscience .
So what I want to suggest to you is that in a traditional way we can achieve this , because , as you see , at least , we 're all masters like Jan Stripling my friend .
So here we have a video of the vibrations that are vibrating .
This second is healthy and somebody is saying , and we can see ourselves as three musical dancers , because we have to incorporate all the sounds that we produce , and we have all the genes that are responsible for that .
It s like three goats it needs to be trained in special training .
I mean , how long would it take a kid to talk ?
From sound , we can actually track the vocal cords as they vibrate , when the sounds are affected by Parkinson s , the sounds that are heard by the sounds .
So in the lower graph , you can see an example of the absence of wires .
We all saw the same symptoms .
We see the tremor , the defibrillllness and the grim .
Live speech became more depressed and more wind after a while , and that s one of the symptoms of it .
These acoustic effects may be really hard to detect , in some cases , but with any digital risk , and with any digital data analytics , we 're using that precise analysis software to match the latest machine knowledge , very advanced , very advanced knowledge today that we can determine what liesposts lie in between the continuing areas between health and disease by just using a voice signal .
So how do all these trials based on this voice compared to the size of a clinical trial ? They both ca n't get along .
The experience of neuroscience is not invasive . They all use the existing infrastructure .
You do n't have to design a whole new hospital system to do this experiment .
And they 're both accurate . But one more thing , bespoke trial is based on non-professional voices .
That means it can be done on its own .
Learning rate , it takes about 30 seconds to be maximum .
Frustrated costs are low , and we all know what s going to happen .
When something is so cheap , it s widely available .
So these are some great targets that I think we can do now .
We can reduce the need for the patient .
They do n't have to go to the clinic to check the test .
We can actually do it at high frequencies so we can have targeted data .
We can employ massively at a very low cost to do clinical trials , and the evaluation on a scale of the population is possible in the first place .
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first biology tags before it s too late .
So in order to make the first step towards this , we 're setting up the first Parkinson s accent program .
So with Acuplab and Patientsburgh LikeMe , we 're aiming at recording our voice with a very large number of people around the world to collect enough data and begin to process four goals .
We have local residents who have access to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Anyone who s healthy or has Parkinson s disease can call it at low cost , and to record it , a few cents per time , and I 'm really pleased to report that we 've achieved six percent of the goal in eight hours .
Thank you .
Tom Rielly : So , by taking all the samples for 10 , 000 people , can you tell who s healthy and who s not ?
What do you get from these samples ?
Max Little : Yeah . Yes . So what happens is , when you have to show up , it s clear if you have a disease , right ?
You see , some of you may not be able to do that . Maybe they ca n't call .
But we 're going to take a lot of data that we 're going to collect from all of these different cases , and the results are really important because we 're going to look at the coincidence of this disease , and we 're going to find the actual signs of this disease .
So what is the accuracy now 86 percent ?
That s much more than that .
In fact , my student Thanasis , I have to praise him , because he did some amazing work , he showed that this could be done on the cell phone , which allowed this project to be done , and the accuracy was reaching 99 percent .
Ninety-nine . Yes , there s a big progress .
So that means that people can -- People can call up from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson s disease can call , take their voice , and then the physician can test their progressions , see their health when they get sick .
Exactly .
Thank you very much . Max Little s Constitution is everybody .
Thank you , Tom .
I live in the South .
This is the South Pole : wine shop , fast food , soil .
So the city planners came together and they were going to change the name of the Southern China to make it different . So they were going to move into Southern Los Angeles Langeles , as if it was going to solve the real problems that are going to happen in the city .
This is the South Los Angeles region .
Fake of wine , fast-food , fast-food , deforestation .
Like 26 . 5 million other Americans , I live in a food desert in Southern Los Angeles , the house of fast food and fast-food storage facilities and running away .
What s interesting is that fast-food in the street is killing more people than accidents and then running away .
In Southern Los Angeles , people are dying of preventable diseases .
For example , the obesity rate in my area is five times higher than Beverly Hills , for example , which is 16 kilometers away .
I was bored to see this happen .
And I wonder , how do you feel when there is no healthy food for your health , when every time you go out of the door , you have to see the bad impacts that the food system is currently making in its place ?
I saw a wheelchair that was sold just like the old car .
I saw blood vessels grow as much as Starbucks .
And I realized that had to stop .
I realized the problem was the solution .
Food is a problem , and food is a solution .
And it seems to me that I 'm also tired of driving 45 minutes just to buy a apple that does n't make a deep infection .
What I did was I planted a food forest in front of my house .
It s on a piece of land we call a trajectory .
It s 3 , 000 feet wide .
The problem is , that land is about the city .
But you have to keep it .
So I thought , Great . I can do what I want , because that s my responsibility and I have to keep it .
And this is how I keep that land .
I got together with my team , the green land . A . , we got together and we started growing food forests : fruit trees , you know , nine vegetables .
We 're a group that shares hostility , which includes gardeners from all walks of life , from all over the city , and they 're completely voluntary , and everything we do is free .
And the garden , it s beautiful .
And then someone complained .
The city came to me , and it was kind of like giving me a work , asking me to break the garden . It was then a building entrance .
And I was like , Come on , really ?
A lot of buildings because planting trees on a land that people do n't care about ?
And I said , Yes . Here you go .
Because this time it s not .
Then the L . A . Times received , Steve Lopez wrote an article about it , and we talked to the board of the board of the council , and then one of the members of the blue pieces of the country sent a request on Change . org , and with 900 letters , we succeeded .
We had a winning battle in our hands .
That deputy council even calls up and says that they agree and love what we 're doing .
I mean , come on , why not ?
L . A . led the U . S . head of the wild area that the city owns .
They own 42 kilos of abandoned land .
That s the same as 20 times the central park .
It s enough to grow 725 million tomatoes .
How do they disagree ?
A tree will give you 1 , 000 , 10 , 000 seeds .
When the green peanut costs you a dollar for the equivalent of 75 dollars .
That s my faith , when I tell people , Let s grow my own food .
Creating your food is the same as printing money .
I have legacy in the South .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
And I refused to be part of this reality that was created , that was created to me by some other people , and I was making my own reality .
I 'm an artist .
The garden is my art . I grew my work .
And just like an artist , the driver of the walls , I feature the grasslands , the pathway .
I used the garden , I used the land as a canvas , and the trees and trees are what I 've located for that fabric .
You 'd be surprised with what the land can do if you turn them into canvas .
You can not imagine how amazing the flowers are and how they affect people .
So what happened ?
I saw my garden as an educational tool , a tool for the transformation of my land .
In order to change communities , you have to change the components of the soil .
We are the land .
You would be surprised to see how children were affected .
Lying is the most potent and most challenging job you can possibly do , especially in inner life .
In retrospect , you can get the strawberries .
I remember once , there was a mother and daughter coming , and it was about 10 : 30 p . m . and they were in my garden , and then I went out and they were embarrassed .
I thought , my goodness , I feel bad because they 're there , and I tell them , you know , two people do n't have to .
This garden is on the road . It s got a reason .
I was so ashamed to see people who were close to me , that they were still hungry , and that was just a little more emphasis on the way for me to do this . People asked me , Fin , do n't you fear that people were going to steal your food ?
And I said , Of course not , I 'm not afraid they 're going to steal .
So they 're just on the road .
That s the whole idea .
I want them to take them , but at the same time , I want them to get their health back .
Again , when I was a garden at a homeless neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles .
These are the men , and they helped me out of the trucks .
So the air is happy , and they share the stories of the gardens that affect them and they 've been growing vegetables with their mothers before , with her , and it s great to see that this idea has changed them , even at that moment .
So the green pieces have continued to grow about 20 acres of gardens .
We had about 50 people participate in training , and they were all voluntary .
If the kids grow their diet , they eat their food .
If they grow tomato , they eat tomato .
But if no one showed them that , if they do n't see the effects of food on the mind and the body , they 're blind to eat whatever is placed in front of them .
I see young people who want to be working , but they 're stuck with something -- I see children who are colorful and they just follow the path that s already there , and it s not going to work .
With gardens , I see an opportunity that we can take kids with their own community burden , and have a sustainable life .
And when we do that , who knows ?
Maybe we 'll generate George Washington Carver the next time .
But if we do n't change the part of the soil , we wo n't be able to do that .
This is one of my projects . This is what I want to do .
I wanted to grow a whole garden where people could share food .
I want to take the car-sharing and turn it into a healthy coffee .
Do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about free stuff , because it s not sustainable .
The interesting thing about sustainability is that you have to keep it up .
I 'm talking about workshops for people , and I 'm pulling the kids out of the street , and I 'm telling them the joy , the pride and the honor of growing food on my own , opening up the farmers ' market .
What I want to do here , we 're going to make it sexy .
I want us all to be green , skilled gardeners .
We 're going to change the concept of fibroid .
If you 're not a gardener , you do n't have to be a container .
Make it with your rope , okay ?
And let s make it a weapon you choose .
Essentially , if you want to meet me , you know , if you want to meet me , do n't call me if you want to sit in seats and get into meetings where you talk about doing this crap .
If you want to meet me , go out to the garden with your lump and we 'll grow something .
Hi . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya south of Nairobi National Park .
In the background I 'm a cowboy of my father , and in the back of the cow , this is the Nairobi National Park .
The Nairobi National Park is not barriered on a large scale in the South , which means that wildlife animals like horses are just getting rid of the park freely .
And so meat animals like lions after them , and these are the things that these lions do .
They kill our cattle .
This is one of the cows that was killed at night , and when I got up in the morning I found it was dead , and I was very sad , because it was the only male that we had .
My community , Maasai , believes we 're from heaven with all of our animals and all our land to keep them , which is why we 're so important .
So I grew up with death hatred .
The Masai soldiers protect our community and the cattle , they 're also very concerned about this .
So they kill lions .
This is one of six lions that was killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is the reason that lions at the Nairobi National Park are very little .
Every son from six to nine years old , in my community , is responsible for keeping his father s buffalos , and I have to do the same thing .
So I had to figure out how to fix this problem .
The first idea I had was to use fire , because I thought lions were afraid of fire .
But then I realized that fire did n't actually work , because it even helped lions see cows .
But I did n't give up . I kept thinking .
And my second idea was to use vision .
I tried to trick these lions to come in and think , Ah , I 'm standing near the cows .
But lions are smart .
They come on the first day and they see the hut look at it , and then they come back , but on the second day , they come and they say this is not moving , it s always there .
And then lions come in and kill cattle .
So one night I picked up a firefly tree that was going around the cow , and on that particular day , the lions did n't come .
I discovered that lions are afraid of moving light .
So I had an idea .
I 've been working in my own room all day , and I 've even opened my new radio radio to buy my mother s new radio that day , and she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electricity .
So I took an old automobile vaccine , a copied clock box , and it was a little device that was found in the car , and it helped the driver to make a car drive when they wanted to turn left or right . It was flashing .
And I have a switch to be able to turn off and turn on the lights .
And that s a little light from a batteries that s broken .
And I built everything .
As you can see , the solar panels are used to make vaccines , and the battery generates energy to the clock box measure . I call it the transducer .
And the clock monitors the lightbulb .
As you can see , the light bulbs are coming out , because that s the way the lion comes in .
And that s how the light goes to the lion at night .
The lightbulbs turned off and trick the lion to make them think that I was walking around the buffalo-cattle , but actually I was sleeping in my bed .
Thank you .
I installed it at my house two years ago , and since then , we have n't had any problems with lions .
Our neighbors hear about this idea .
One of them is this lady .
She had so many cattle who had been killed , and she asked me if I could help her build the shadows .
And I said , Yes .
So I set up the light bulbs . You can see in the back , they 're the lions .
So far , I 've been building seven families in my community , and they work .
Now my idea has been used all over Kenya to disrupt other cannibals such as hyena , newspaper , and it s also used to threaten the herd from the farmer of the people .
Through this invention , I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship out to one of the best schools in Kenya , the International University of Brookhouse , and I was very excited about this .
My new environment is beginning to help by raising and raising awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we built a lamp for the families that did n't get close to it , and I taught them how to build them .
A year ago , I was just a young boy on the cows latrine lamp for my father , and I 'd seen airplanes fly around , and I said to myself one day , I 'll be sitting inside it .
And I 'm here today .
I had the opportunity to come here with an airplane for the first time to come to TED .
My dream is to become a plane engineer and a pilot as they grow up .
I used to hate lions , but now because of my invention I was saving the cows of my father and lions , we can live with lions without any conflict .
Asholyolan . In my language , it means thank you very much .
I do n't know how much it s interesting to hear your story .
So I had this scholarship . Yes .
You 're doing other electrons .
What s the next invention on your list ?
Your next invention , you want to make a wire . What about the telegraph ?
I know that the power fence was invented , but I wanted to do my own thing .
I tried , yes , and I did . . . I tried it before , but I stopped by an electrical shock .
Richard Turere , I 'm so different .
We 're going to force our grandchildren in the way that you 're going to walk , little guy .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
What I did , and what I did as a specialist -- my life had been shaped for seven years at work in Africa .
From 1971 to 1977 -- my grandfather was n't that young -- I was working in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , Somalia , in the technological projects with African countries .
I worked for Italian NGOs , and every project we created in Africa failed .
I was hooked .
When I was 21 years old , I thought , Italians are good people , and we 're doing a good job in Africa .
But instead , we were killing everything that we were trying to touch .
The first project , which inspired my first book , the light waves from Zambezi , was a project in which Italians decided to teach Zambia to grow food .
So we were in southern Zambia with seeds from Italy in a beautiful valley all over the river of Zambei , and we were teaching the modern , Italian culturally populated , Italian , Italian grownup , and so on .
Of course the indigenous people were n't interested in doing this , so we paid them , and sometimes they came to work .
We were really amazed about the indigenous people in the valley of fat that this did n't work .
But instead of asking them why they did n't grow anything , we simply said , Thank God we were here .
It s time to save Zambia from hunger .
And of course , everything in Africa has gone well .
We have these wonderful tomato sauce . In Italy , a tomato is about the size of this thing . At Zambia , it s about this size .
That s incredible , and we said to the Zambia people , You know , this is an easy thing to do .
When tomato sauce begins , nine , and in red , only one night , about 200 galaxies from below the umbrella up and cleaned all the way up .
We told the Zambia people , Oh my God , the cotton !
And people say , Well , that s why we 're not growing anything here .
So why do n't people tell us the story first ? Have you ever asked .
I thought that only every Italian was scrambling on Africa , but after I looked at what Americans are doing , what the U . S . people are doing , what the French are doing , and after seeing what they 're doing , I felt like I had something to be proud of my project at Zambia .
Because , you see , at least we can also grow these colored galaxies .
You should look at the irony -- you should look at the mysterious thing that we 've given to people in Africa who are not skeptical .
You want to read a book , read the Dalai Lama , written by Dambisa Moyo , a Zambia economist .
The book was launched in 2009 .
We , the Western aid nations , brought the African continent , two billion Kim in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you the costs that the money has caused .
Just read her book .
Reading it from a woman in Africa , the damage that we 've caused .
The Western elites , like us , are imperialists , Muslims , and we have only two ways to deal with one another : either to support or support , or defend .
Two words are derived from Latin Tiptoater , which means father .
They have two different meanings .
Protection is , I treat anyone from one culture as if they were my child . I love them .
For aid , I treat everyone from one culture like mine .
That s why white people in Africa are called bwana , the owner .
I was overlooked in the face of reading the book , Smart , but it was beautiful , written by Schuseter , who said , above all , in economic growth , if others do n't need help , let s wear them .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle about aid is respect .
This morning , the organizers put a stick on the floor , and they said , Can we imagine a city without a new democratization ?
When I was 27 years old , I decided to just affect people and I created a system called Enterprise Faciers , where you would n't start anything you never motivate , but to be a person who is really passionate about wanting to be , filled with local people , filled with people who have dreams of wanting to be a better person .
So you do it -- you close your mouth .
Never bring a community with ideas , you sit with the local people .
We do n't work from offices .
We met at the cafeteria . We met with alcohol .
We do n't have any infrastructure .
And what we did was we became friends , and we figured out what that person wanted to do .
The most important thing is aspiration .
You can give somebody an idea .
If the person does n't want to do it , then what do you have to do ?
Women s aspiration for growth is the most important thing .
What men s aspiration for growth is the most important thing .
And we helped them do the research , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
Those of you who have an idea may not have an understanding , but an understanding that s always there .
So many years ago , I had this idea : Why do n't we , one time , instead of one , go to a community , and tell those people what they should do , why do n't we listen to them just once ? But not in public meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There was a problem in community meetings .
Those entrepreneurs never come , and they 're never going to tell you , in a community meeting , what they want to do with their money , the opportunity they 've just found .
So this plan has a blind spot .
The smartest people in the community you 'll never know because they 're not going to come to the public meetings .
What we do is we work one-to-one and to do that , you have to create the existing social structure that does n't exist .
You have to create a new field .
A new discipline like a family doctor for a business , a family doctor who works for a job , who sits with you in your house , at the cafeteria table , at the cafeterias , and helps you find resources to make your aspirations into a living way .
I started as an experiment in Esperance , Australia .
I was doing my Ph . D . at that time , trying to get away from the encyclopedia is to come and tell you what to do .
So what I did the first year at Esperance was just the encyclopedia on the road , and in three days I had my first client , Maori , and I helped him sell a fish to a restaurant in Perth , and to reorganize the job , and then a fisherman came up to me and said , Can you help Maori ? Can you help me ?
And I helped these fishing guys know how to work together and sell these great fish , not for a toy factory at Albany at 60 cents with a symbols , but we could find a way to sell them to Japan to make a sushi for 15 dollars , and then the farmers came up and said , Hey , can you help us ?
In one year , I had 27 government projects in a row and the government came up to me and asked me , How do you do that ?
He did this -- and I said , Well , I did a very hard job .
I 'm silent , and I 'm listening to them .
So the government told me , Go ahead .
We did that at 300 communities around the world .
We 've started 40 , 000 jobs .
There s a new entrepreneur generation who s exhausted for isolation .
Peter Drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died when he was 96 , a few years ago .
Peter Drucker is a philosopher of philosophy before working on business , and this is what Peter Drucker said : The space really does n't correspond to a society and a business economy .
The definition is that the kiss is dead for the entrepreneur .
So right now you 're reconstructing Muschurch without knowing what the smartest people in church want to do with their money and their potential .
You had to learn how to get these people to talk to you .
You have to give them security , privacy , you have to be really excited to help them , and they will come , along with the crowd of people coming .
With a 10 , 000 people , we could have about 200 customers .
Can you imagine a community of 400 , 000 people , intelligence and aspiration ?
What talks do you clap the most this morning ?
Local people , people who love it . These are the people who you 've claimed .
So what I 'm saying is , Business is where it is .
We are at the last stage of the Industrial Revolution -- with the unreconstructed , unreconstructed , unsustainable systems , we have unsustainable systems .
The internal combustion engine .
Freon s path to storing things is unsustainable .
What we have to look at is how we 're going to nurture , treat , treat , educate , move and communicate to seven billion people in a sustainable way .
There s no technology to do that .
Which one will invent the technology for the green revolution ? Business schools forgot !
Governments ? Forget !
They 're going to be anonymous , and they 're doing it right now .
There was a great story that I read in a magazine many years ago .
There s a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York City in 1860 .
And in 1860 , the group of people came together , and they speculated that what was going to happen to New York City in the next 100 years , and the conclusion was that the New York City would n't be in the next 100 years .
Why ? Because they 're looking at the curve on the map and saying , if the population continues to grow on this scale , to move the population of New York City , they 're going to need six million horses , and the waste from six million horses is going to have no way of handling them .
They would be flooded with silk in horses .
So in 1860 , they saw this iron technology that made people s lives in New York City breathe .
So what happened ? In 40 years , to the point of 1900 , in the U . S . , there were 1 , 000 car manufacturers , 1 , 001 .
The idea of looking for a different technology is completely outweighed above all , and there are very , very small factories in this situation .
Dearborn , MIchigan . Henry Ford .
However , there s a secret to working with entrepreneurs .
First of all , you have to give them security .
Otherwise they 're not going to come to talk to you .
And then you have to give them a fantastic , special and exciting service .
And then you have to tell them the real truth about business .
The smallest company , the biggest company , has to be able to do three great things : The product you want to sell is perfect , you have to get the perfect rating strategy , and you have to have a perfect financial stewardship .
Now , think about it .
We 've never met a single person in the world , who has just been able to make it , sell it and manage money at the same time .
That does n't exist .
This character was never born .
We did a study , and we looked at 100 typical companies in the world of Carnegie , Wofford , Edison , Ford , Ford , all new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There s only one thing that every successful company in the world has , one thing only : No company begins with only one .
Now we teach 16 year-old youth entrepreneurship at Northumberland , we started the classroom by giving them the first two papers about Richard Branson s biography , and the work for those 16-year-old jellyfish is bricks , in the first two pages of Richard Branson s biography of how many times he used me and how many times he used from us .
Never have the word I do , and we have 32 times .
He did n't start alone .
He started a company alone . No one .
So we can create a community where there are people who have the basic experience of micro-enterprise enterprises sitting in the coffee shop , in the cafeteria , the wine cafeteria , and those of you who are dedicated to what someone has done to them who has made them talk about this hero who s going to ask you , What do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you do it ?
OK , can you sell it ? Can you run money ?
Oh , no , no , I ca n't do this . Do you want me to find somebody else for you ?
We activate communities .
We have these volunteers who are helping Enterprise Facitator , helping them find resources and people , and we 've found that the magic that is out of local intelligence is as if you can challenge the culture and the economy of this community by just seeing the desire , the energy and imagination as your people are .
Thank you .
And by March , 2011 , I was a photojournalist in New York City .
We 're green creatures .
It s in the darkness of a windowless room , and in general , it s avoiding the sun .
We adjusted for the wetsuit , the more beautiful the skin , the more beautiful it became , and we were constantly getting critical criticism in the newspaper , but we also had talented artists with years of experience and knowledge about images and photography .
In November 2011 , we were watching the world at home , and I saw catastrophic events happening in Japan .
And then , the volunteer organization that I attended was the Hands Volunteers , and for the past few days , it was a part of the response effort .
I , along with hundreds of volunteers , learned that I could n't just sit at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On May 13 , I found my way to the Manhattan town of Chilfunato .
It s a small village in Iwate , with a population of about 50 , 000 people , one of the first places to be affected by tsunami .
The water in this country is recorded to be more than 24 meters , and it s been escalated over three miles deep in the soil .
Imagine , a town had been destroyed .
We pull the pieces out of the channel , the tunnel .
Clean out of school , homes , ready for innovation and for rehabilitation .
We cleaned up tons of cruelty and sanctuary fishing and sweating from a local restaurant station .
We lettuce , but we 're all happy .
For weeks , volunteers and local people were looking for the same thing .
They were looking for photos and albums and cameras and SD cards .
We all do that .
They collected and discussed them to preserve them in places around the markets .
It was n't until then that I realized that these pictures were actually a huge loss of personal loss in these people .
When they run the wave , to keep the revolution , they 've left everything , everything is left behind .
And at the end of the first week there , I went to help a rehabilitation center in the town .
I helped cleanse public hot water , huge bathtub .
And this is a place where the serendipitous community was collecting the photos .
This is where people talk to them , and that day I honor them , because they trust me to help them clean up the photos .
It was an emotional and fun thing . I had to listen to this before , but only if I was really struck by that , a new memory happened .
When I look through these pictures , there are a few more than a hundred years old , some are still in the envelope from the shower room . I think , as a photojournalist I can fix this and this mud , and I know , hundreds of other people can do the same .
So I went to Facebook and asked a couple of people , and I came up to the morning , and I got a lot of positive feedback , and I knew I had to start working .
We started to fix these images .
Here s the first one .
No harm spoiled , but the water is filled with water that changes her face , has to be repaired with extreme and dense precision .
If not , girls in the picture would n't look like me anymore , and that would certainly be bad as the image would be broken .
Over time , very luckily , many images were taken back , and I needed more people to edit , so , again , I went to Facebook and LinkedIn , for five days , I found 80 people who wanted to help from 12 different countries .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people who wanted to participate .
In Japan , in July , we 've expanded Rikuzentakenata s neighbors , farther north to Yamada town .
Once a week , we installed our scanning device in the temporary library , so that people would come up with their photos .
Older women are sometimes not seen a scanner , but after 10 minutes , find their lost image , give us a scanner to scan it , upload it to a cloud server , to download it by an igajin , a stranger , somewhere in the world , and start to be edited .
The time it took to restore the restoration of the situation was a completely different story , and it was obviously dependent on the harm of this image .
It can take an hour . It can take a week .
It can take months .
The kimono in this picture is mostly painted by hand , or by joints , from all the colors and details that are completely unbroken .
It took a lot of time .
Now , all of these images have been damaged , drowned in salt water , covered in bacteria , covered in water , sometimes in oil , sometimes in oil , so they 're much more likely to continue to kill . So it s a big part of the project .
We could n't fix it if it was n't clean , dry and reclaimed .
We were lucky to wipe out images with our hands .
There s a great local woman who mentions us .
It s a lot more vulnerable to these images .
My team Wynne once said , It s like tattoos for somebody .
You have no opportunity to make mistakes .
And the women brought us these images were lucky , when they could be recovered .
She wiped them clean and stopped when she realized she was doing it much more damage .
She also had a copy of the picture .
Otherwise , places like her husband and her face would never be restored , would just put them together in another good image , and reconstructed the whole picture .
When she got the photos from us , she shared a little bit of her story .
These pictures were found by her husband who found in a firefight , amongst the fragments from long distances from where there was a house ravaged , and they realized that he had this guy .
The day after the tsunami , he was responsible for stagnating the tsunami .
He had to go towards the water as the press rose .
Two little boys , and now her two sons are in school , two different schools .
A child is stuck in the water .
Every week , she found them and she knew they were all alive .
The day I returned to her was the day that her son was 14 years old .
For her , after all of these images were the perfect gifts for him , something it could be reviewed , to remember the past that had never been fearful of paranoia since that March , when the whole life was shattered or destroyed .
After six months in Japan , 1 , 100 volunteers joined the All All Hands , in which hundreds of people had been more clean than 135 , 000 photos , most of them -- most of them had come back to their owners , which is a very important thing .
Over hundreds of global volunteers have helped to pay over 90 families , hundreds of photos have been completely recovered and corrected .
In this time , we have n't spent so much time with devices and materials , most of the cost is to the printer .
We photographed all the time .
Each image reminds someone or something , a place , a relationship , a lover .
They are the records of our memories and our story , which is the last thing that we 're attached to and the first thing that we come back to .
That means the whole project , restoring small bits of humanity , bringing connections back to somebody else .
When a picture like this is delivered , it s going to make a huge difference in people s lives .
The project also creates a huge difference in people s lives of photojournalists .
For some people , they were connected to something larger , giving something to themselves , using it to something other than the buffalo-cattle and the leather lanes .
I want to read an email to finish this talk . This is from Cindy , who helped to fix it , sent me the day I came back from Japan after six months .
When I was working , I could n't help but think of each and every single story that was contained in the images .
There s a picture , a lot of women in the house , from old age to children , dressed around a baby , that touched me because I had the same picture , my mom , my mom , my mother , and the new daughter , the picture of the house .
On the other side of the globe , no matter what age , our basic needs are the same , right ?
Thank you .
I was at nearly 500-centimeter deep under an illegal mine in Ghana .
The air is dust and it s hot , and it s very difficult to breathe .
I could feel the collision from my body of silently sweating through the darkness , but I could n't see it more .
I heard a voice , but mostly the tunnel is a mixture of the sound and the sound is cracked with raw tools .
As you can see , I put a cheap , low-cost cell lamp on my head , and it was attached to an old rubber loop , and I could barely see the magnificent shadows that were helping the walls of the super-0 . 28 feet across the ground .
When I slid my arm , I remember the new mining guy who came up a few days ago who had slipped his arm and fell down to that tunnel .
When I 'm talking to you today , these people are still going to be deep inside that hole , taking a life of no salaries or fog , and usually going to die .
I 'm climbed out of that hole , and I get home , but they probably never get home , because they 've been trapped into slaves .
Over the last 28 years , I 've been documenting local culture documents over 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the privilege of being the only exhibit at the Vancouver Embassy in Vancouver .
Among the incredible talented people I met there , I met a supporter of the Emancipation campaign , a member of NGO who defies the genocide of the modern slavery .
We started talking about slaves , and actually , I began to learn about slaves because I knew it was there in the world , but it was n't that far .
After this talk , I was really awful and really embarrassed by this ignorance in my life , and I thought , if I do n't know , how many people do n't know ?
It started to pause , so a few weeks later , I flew to Los Angeles to meet the Emancipation Department and asked them to help .
And it began the journey into the modern world .
Strange that I 'd been to most of these places before .
Some places I consider my house .
But this time , I want to see the truth being covered .
A conservative estimation tells us that there are over 27 million people who are being made slaves in the world today .
Half the people were taken out of Africa during the sales age of slaves across the Atlantic Ocean .
150 years ago , a slave was three times the income of an American worker .
That s the equivalent of 50 , 000 U . S . dollars today .
But today , many families are being enslaved for generations with only 18 dollars .
Incredibly , slavery produces over 13 billion dollars a year in profits around the world .
A lot of people were accused of a better education , a better job , just to find themselves being arrested not with violence , and not out of it .
The rate today is to serve trade , the goods that the slaves create is valuable , but the people who make it look like waste .
The slaves are present almost everywhere in the world , even though it s illegal everywhere .
In India and Nepal , I went to a brick .
This incredibly beautiful landscapes are like going into the ancient Egyptian world or Dante Hill .
It s wrapped around with more than 54 degrees of temperature , men , women , children , all of the families , are covered in this blindfold , just like a machine , rolling it up , all the way up to 18 members per time , and bringing them from the big-carts to the trucks that are hundreds of meters away .
Wait by their oversimplicity and exhaust , they 're silent at work , repeatedly at 16 or 17 hours a day .
There was no food , now to eat , because it was a big waste of water , so it was okay to go to the bottom of the ladder .
Coal and dust were so hot that my camera was so hot that it was impossible to touch the stop button .
Every 20 minutes , I had to run back into the car to wipe the device out and let them work under the heat conditioning to rehabilitate them , and when I was sitting there , I thought , My camera is more likely to be treated than any other person .
When I go back to the city , I just want to cry , but the slave capitalists next to me very quickly grabbed me and said , Lisa , do n't do that . Do n't do that .
He explained to me that emotions are dangerous in a place like this , not for me , but for them .
I could n't help them directly .
I did n't give them money , nothing .
I 'm not a citizen .
I can get them to their current situation .
I had to rely on the Climate Empires to work in the system to release them , and I believe they can .
For me , it was time to go home to really feel the pain .
In the Himalayas , I saw the child kicking over many miles of mountain territory down the aisle waiting at the bottom .
Little balls are more heavy than the ones that are carrying them , the children who are lifting them up on their heads using pieces of wood , rope and canvas .
Adaptability is so heavy .
How do we create this thing , the rest of the lanes ?
Some people do n't even know they 're enslaved , they work without 16 , 17 hours a day , 17 hours a day , because they only know that .
They have nothing to compare .
When this village demanded freedom , the slaves burned their homes .
These people have nothing , they die , they want the first , but the women in the middle of the town are comfortable , and the modern slave fundamentalists are helping them to get their own stone contracts , so that now they 're still working on their back , but they 're working for themselves , and they 're paid , and they 're paid for free .
We tend to think about sexual slavery when I hear about slavery , and because of this common perception , I 'm told it s going to be very difficult to work safe in this particular industry .
In Kathmandu , I was hooked by women who were sexual slaves .
They took me down the stairs into the dirty tunnel , in the faint light .
This is actually not a territory .
It s more like a restaurant .
Ordinary restaurants , as known as in the field , are places of rape prostitution .
Every place there is a little room where slaves , women , girls and girls , some seven , some seven years old , are being resolved to their customers , for example , they buy alcohol and food .
The bedroom is nasty and dark and dark , and it s recognized by the numbers of paint on the wall by a slide and curtains .
So this person here is often susceptible to sexual abuse in their customers ' hands .
And on that particular dark side , I remember the fear of the awe , and at that moment , I understood what it was like to be confined in that hell .
There s only one way : the staircase from which I came in .
There was no backdoor .
There are n't big windows that are geeky .
These people have no escape hassles , when we talk about such a difficult topic , need to remember that slaves , including the slaves of sexual selling , are also happening in the place where we live .
Hundreds of thousands of people were enslaved in agriculture , in the restaurants , filled with malignancy in the home , and the list is long .
Recently , The New York Times reported that between 100 , 000 and 300 , 000 children in the United States are sold as sexual slaves every year .
It s around us . We just do n't see it .
The textile industry is often thought of when it comes to slavery .
I went to many villages in India , where many families were slaved in the silk trade .
This is a family portrait .
The black hands are the father , the blue hands and red ones are his son .
They mixed the dyes in big containers , and they shoved it into a solution that was filled with goggles , even though the dye was very toxic .
My translator tells their story .
They said , We do n't have freedom .
But there s still hope that one day can get out of this house and go somewhere else where we get paid to wear fabric .
It s estimated that there are over 4 , 000 children who are slaving slaves in Volta , the largest artificial lake in the world .
When I first got there , I went through a tour .
I feel like a family was fishing on the boat , two brothers , some smaller boys , that would make sense .
Wrong . They 're all slaves .
Kids are taken out of families , selling and disappearing , and are caught to work without any harm on these ships , even though they do n't know how to swim .
This one is eight years old .
She was shaking as our ship got closer , fearing the boat through her tiny canoe .
He was terrified of falling into the water .
And the branches that are packed in Volta are often associated with fishing nets , and the kids who have just been so frustrated and afraid of being pushed into the water to take their tongue .
They were drowned .
What he remembered , was that he was arrested at work in the lake .
I 'm afraid of the owner , I 'm not going to escape , and because of a terrible treatment at a child , I 'm going to go on to the smaller slaves that she s run .
I met these boys at five o'clock in the morning , and they were pulling their final bows , but they were working one morning .
It was cold on the cold side of the night .
It s important to note that these networks are nearly 5000-pound when they 're full of fish .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
Kofi was saved from a village .
I saw him in the aid room that the Emancipation Embassy has restored its slaves .
Here she is in the bathroom , blowing these big bottles of water on the head , and the great news is that , when you and I are sitting here today , Kofi was united with his family , and better , the children were given the tools to create a living and keep the children safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of possibilities .
What would you be if somebody stood up and changed your life ?
Running on the streets of Ghana , also my colleagues in the Climate Empire , a friend of mine who was a slave trader , who had a surprise riding up our car and knocking on the door .
He told us to follow the pathway in the woods .
At the end of the road , he took us out of the car , and he told us to drive away .
And then just point into this blurry footprint and say , Here s the way , here s the way . Go .
And in that way , we dragged the coastal wires , and after about an hour of walking in the woods , the trace was underwater after the rains , so I put the tools on top of the tip when we went down into the chest .
After two hours of running around , the trace around the drums ended in the empty space , and before our eyes was a paralyzed area of black holes with a football field , they were filled with slaves .
Many of the women in the back of the gold , and they float through the water with the glass water .
The bank was used in the process of extracting it .
These guys are enslaved into the tunnel of Ghana in another part of Ghana .
When they get out of the tunnel , they get drunk with their sweat .
I still remember looking into their red eyes , tired eyes because a lot of people were under the ground to 72 hours .
The tunnels go all the way down to a hundred meters , and they put them on these heavy , thick bags to move them to another area , where they 're being carried for gold .
Look , the stone field seems to be full of healthy people , but when you go closer , there s fewer luck working in extreme extreme conditions , there s children .
They 're all victims of vulnerability , disease and violence .
In fact , much more likely that this muscle will eventually be like this one , with T . B . tuberculosis and glass infections in a few years .
This is Manuru . When his father died , he was brought to the mines working with him .
When the person died , Manuru admitted his debt , and was forced to be slaved in the mine even longer .
When I met , he worked 14 years in the mine , and the wound that you see here is from a train accident , a leg that was so heavy that the doctor said to have to take the coat .
On top of that , Manuru had a tuberculosis , but she was still being caught day after day in that tunnel .
And yet , he dreamed of being free to go to school with the help of local activists like the Innovation Foundation , and determined like this , appealing to the face of extraordinary people , which led me full of resilience .
I want to show the slaves to light .
When I was working in this field , I brought a lot of candles , and with the help of the translator , I translated it to people that I 'd like to light their stories and their circumstances , and then they were safe to take these photos .
They know their pictures will be seen by the people out there , like you .
I want them to know that we 're going to do the evidence for them , and we 're going to do whatever we can to help them change their lives .
I really believe , if you consider other people as savors , it s very difficult to drill pink crimes like slaves .
The images are not about themselves . They 're about people , people , like you and me , are all worthy of equal rights , honor and respect in their lives .
No day I did n't think of all these amazing people who were buried with them . I had a great honor to meet them .
I hope that these images will wake up a powerful force in the viewer , people like you , and hopefully that fire will fire , and that fire will shine in slavery , because without that light , the monsters of the incarceration will continue to live in the dark .
Thank you very much .
